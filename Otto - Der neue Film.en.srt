00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:32,998
Moment, Maestro, haven't
we forgotten something?

166
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:37,790
Back then there was a custom,
one didn't leave without a farewell gift.

167
00:09:38,374 --> 00:09:40,082
That's a lovely custom.

168
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,166
No, no.

169
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,582
[Groaning]

170
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,916
Here I have something for
you, something quite personal.

171
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:55,582
Hm, shame, unfortunately
unsuitable as wanted posters.

172
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,416
Well then, let's go.

173
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:02,415
In here!

174
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,041
Stop!

175
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:11,124
[Door slams shut]

176
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,291
I want to read you
something nice."

177
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:24,873
Oh oh oh, what do we have here?

178
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,540
Can I trust my eyes, is
a month's rent missing?

179
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,291
Or two? Or in the end even...

180
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,166
Three months' rent, Yes indeed.

181
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:39,415
Three months' rent you owe, and
without it you won't get away.

182
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,624
Then I'll just leave them
here!  [Laughs mischievously]

183
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:46,665
You are funny. But whether
the judge will also find that funny.

184
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:50,332
They're supposed to be cracking
down hard again lately, on malicious,

185
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:53,082
intentional rental fraud!
[Suspenseful music]

186
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:57,291
Defendant, I sentence you to 2,000
Deutsche Marks or 5 years imprisonment!

187
00:10:57,374 --> 00:10:59,499
-Then I'll take the money.
 -Huh?

188
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,999
Anna. Anna!

189
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,541
Call the "bulls."

190
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,874
[Loud banging] I can't, Father.

191
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:11,874
I guess I'll have to do it myself, no
one else wants to do this dirty work.

192
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:15,248
No no, you shouldn't, you
are right and need help.

193
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:18,165
If you had a young man who
took care of everything for you...

194
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,999
-A kind of slave?
-Yes, then it does everything for you!

195
00:11:21,124 --> 00:11:22,165
-Him?

196
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,915
I'm taking everything down, even
the receiver, should I call the police?

197
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:28,040
Hold on, you're not getting
away from me that easily.

198
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,416
I have something for you,
something completely new.

199
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,916
You've never experienced anything
like this in your whole life, Work!

200
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:36,207
-Good job! 
 -Work?

201
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:39,249
Right dirty work, that
nobody does? I'll do it!

202
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:40,582
[Kissing sounds]

203
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:45,166
Formerly slaves had heavy chains, with
thick iron balls attached to them.

204
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,624
That was very enjoyable.

205
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:52,207
But what do I do if he takes off, before
everything is done, in 10 months?

206
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:54,749
He won't do
that, I guarantee it.

207
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:56,915
For whom?

208
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:59,624
Look at him,  fleeing
forehead, fleeing eyes,

209
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:02,123
fleeing nose, fleeing
mouth, fleeing chin.

210
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:04,498
If you don't watch out,
the rest will also leave.

211
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:07,373
No, there's only one language
that these guys understand.

212

[Loud, metallic banging]

213
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:18,874
If you hear this sound,
be here immediately!

214
00:12:19,207 --> 00:12:22,582
Otherwise, he'll get
you. Grab Harras!

215
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:23,874
Hold it!

216
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,332
Hold on, Harras!

217
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,457
Quiet! [Dog howling]

218
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,416
It's unbelievable, he
doesn't get it again.

219
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:29,749
You shall bite him!

220
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,623
-Should I bite him?
-Idiot!

221
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:33,040
To the Labor Front,

222
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,832
you bring that down there, Anna.

223
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,249
And you bring Harras
up, to Professor Edelson.

224
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:40,999
He should take on that mutt,
so he can bite properly again!

225
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:42,582
Grrr!

226
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:47,332
Don't be afraid, I'll take you to the professor, and
in the meantime I'll tell you a story.

227
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:54,457
Then a dog came towards me,
and lifted its leg, I was afraid.

228
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,416
But the owner said, "Don't
worry, he doesn't bite!"

229
00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:01,124
Bite, I thought
he'd kick! [giggles]

230
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:03,082
Not so funny?

[Parrot squawks]

[Doorbell]

236
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:22,041
That's nonsense, animal testing, we
don't want anyone to experiment on us.

237
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:28,582
There he is, our
little failure.

[Dog howls]

239

Don't want to be evil anymore?

240
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,624
There I'll probably have
to be mean first, won't I?

sends you heaven.

could really use right now. Come.

no account leave this room.

[more metallic

So, now it's right again, are
you listening to anything else?

-No. -There you
go, I told you so.

Great car, how fast does it go?

00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:10,249
Ah, the car, you'd better
ask how far we can go.

We can drive afterwards,
You have to see me driving.

[Otto stomps loudly to the door]

-And what is that stupid hag doing there?
-What? What? Stupid goose?

501
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:45,082
Oh, ah, AH! An emergency!
The hag has gone idiotic!

502
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:48,374
Is she completely
or just partly idiotic?

503
00:29:48,457 --> 00:29:49,748
Are you totally crazy?

504

comes from a lot of heads in the water.

Miss Gaby, I have some
difficult news.

There is in the life of a doctor
a fork in the road, save lives or

509
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:13,374
Speaking up, even with a demi-god
in white, the money has to be right.

-I'm inviting you on a tour

Could you invite me for dinner?

I'm back from the coal front!

-No.
-Then wash yourself, but hurry up!

you say that right away.

But one question
I have for you:

619
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:35,041
In winter '71 during the Ardennes Offensive 
the horse of Field Marshal von Ranzau was

literally shot dead
under his ass.

I don't know that.

Do 5,000 push-ups, but
quick, quick!

624
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:48,541
Five thousand? That can't I do.

625
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:50,082
You can't do that.

626
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:52,915
Then at least make
this grenade live.

627
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:54,415
I'm not doing that!

628
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,790
So, you don't do that.

629
00:38:58,582 --> 00:39:00,832
<nuschelnd>So
you admit it yourself:

You know nothing, you
can do nothing,

631
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:06,291
and you're doing nothing.

632
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:08,499
And you also want
money for that?

633
00:39:09,082 --> 00:39:10,748
I know something
much better for you!

635
00:39:13,124 --> 00:39:16,124
Today? On Sunday? Right now?

636
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:18,791
But no. Immediately!

637
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,832
Axis, that's something else.

638
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:24,207
[Speaks softly, slams
the door] Asshole.

639

[creaking]

640
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:39,082
Who has been working
hard all week for others,

641
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:43,832
He honestly earned
himself the weekend.

642
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:47,165
Or Harras?

643
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:50,707
We even make them work for
us on weekends, always on call.

644
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:52,582
Yes sir.

645
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:57,332
Already done, that was quick. The
whole yard was full of rubbish anyway!

646
00:39:57,749 --> 00:39:59,540
Ah, the little farm…

647
00:39:59,624 --> 00:40:02,665
The courtyard also seems
smaller and smaller to me,

648
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:06,832
-I have to check that out.
-Why bother, it's on TV!

649
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:08,707
Everything looks so much
smaller there, look at the announcer!

650
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:10,582
Be quiet, she wants
to say something.

651
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:13,416
Ladies and gentlemen, in
our series with Amboss films,

652
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:16,915
Now watch \"Amboss
- The Controller".

653
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:21,999
In this 1984 film, Amboss
portrays a subway controller!

654
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:28,207
Well Harras, this is a
film for the family, isn't it?

655
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:30,874
[Screams from the television]

656
00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:33,374
Harras barks] What
do you say?

657
00:40:33,457 --> 00:40:35,248
You want to go for a
walk again? Alright then!

658
00:40:35,582 --> 00:40:38,207
Come on, loser! Once
around the whole block!

659
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:40,957
Come on!

660

[Harras barks]

662

Man!

665
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,416
Come on,  that
takes too long!

666
00:41:09,082 --> 00:41:10,082
That's enough!

667
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:13,916
Let go of the leash Dog barking

668
00:41:14,624 --> 00:41:16,915
Phew! Man, finally!

669
00:41:20,957 --> 00:41:22,873
At last!

670
00:41:23,124 --> 00:41:26,374
There you are, stupid
dog, you missed half the movie.

671
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:28,249
Look there.

672
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:30,457
Now he's giving
it to him full blast!

673
00:41:31,249 --> 00:41:33,207
That's the fare dodger line!

674
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:36,791
There they all sit, all
the punks and rockers,

Right now Amboss will
finish them all off!

Do you really
want to look at that?

Shouldn't we go outside, into

had in the movie "The Eliminator"!

Can you think of
nothing else, Miss Gaby?

707
00:43:23,874 --> 00:43:27,165
Yes, I have to think of
an airplane right now,

708
00:43:27,249 --> 00:43:30,790
in that sits Amboss, and
right away it lands with us.

-Where else then?

Then let's try it!

car, purrs like a mustache,

special commission

won't make it to the airport at all!

up, and I see nothing of Amboss.

just something about an Amboss,

Can we finally
go to the airport?

727

To the airport? Haven't
you heard the radio?

728
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:41,416
What do we want there, it's
much nicer here, just the two of us.

-Faster still?

I'm stopping you?

ever be able to stop again?

Oh, you flashed me? Did
the photos turn out sharp?

744

for my companion, and one for the stop sign.

Would you like one
too?  Then we'll take four.

mother has that, she's reading it right now.

May I introduce, Miss Drösel.

Why won't it continue?
What are you waiting for?

Tell him that you are
Professor Edelson.

upright, lawkeeper will be impressed.

a friend of the police chief, or?

I'm sorry, I only
have 10 marks.

Well, then, let's
turn a blind eye.

-Over there!
 -Can't it be any smaller?

776

Make yourselves smaller!

 -To the greatest of all time.

-And that's us there. 
 -But, this isn't a restaurant.

But the best cook of all.

785

Mother Nature takes care of us.

she sets our table.

May I seat you?

Yes, Mother Nature
has already provided.
