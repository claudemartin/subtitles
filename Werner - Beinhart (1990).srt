1
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,990
(Speaker) As Adalbert Amen
on that memorable autumn evening

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,160
closed the church door, he had no idea
how soon he would be a witness...

3
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,160
to a mysterious mystery.

4
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,900
Crucifix!

5
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,240
(Drum roll, applause)

6
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,150
Thank you. Thank you!

7
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,870
(Speaker) He would see what no human eye had looked upon before.

8
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,070
Hear what no human ear had ever heard. He still didn't know

9
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,240
that one day he would reveal his secret to save a great...

10
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,450
artist from greatest need. But let us see and hear for ourselves.

11
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,910
(Music)

12
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,650
Today I bake, tomorrow I brew,

13
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,660
and the day after tomorrow I'll fetch Werner!

14
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,570
Yes!

15
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,290
(Wood cracks)

16
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,740
Ah, how good that nobody knows,
that I am called Rumpelstiltskin!

17
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,360
Hard as a rocker,
hard as a chopper,

18
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,070
hard as a bottle of beer,
it's going hard from here.

19
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,120
We don't go chic to restaurants
and nibble delicately on lobster tails.

20
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,990
We don't smell like Eau de Toilette,
we sniff chain grease.

21
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,040
We ride easy over hill and dale,

22
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,160
only a guardrail can stop us!

23
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,110
Dengel, dengel, dengel, dengel.

24
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,910
Hard as a rocker,
hard as a chopper,

25
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,370
hard as a bottle of beer,
that's how hard it goes here.

26
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,570
Don't put the camper there
or you'll have a tunnel in it!

27
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,990
Don't close them, leave
them open, the gate!

28
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,860
Let us through there,
otherwise it will give Zanke!

29
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,570
We ride easy over hill and dale,

30
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,650
only a delimitation post can stop us!

31
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,400
Dengel, dengel, dengel,
dengel. Hard as a rocker,

32
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,870
hard as a chopper,
hard
as a bottle of beer,

33
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,200
bone-hard it goes from here.

34
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,990
Past the cow and past the
bull, we overtake the police too.

35
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,160
We are the wild ones and uncontrollable,
when we iron over all the slopes.

36
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,200
We ride easy over hill and dale,

37
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,320
only a barrier post can stop us!

38
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,820
Dengel, dengel, dengel,
dengel. Bone-hard like a rocker,

39
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,450
bone hard like a chopper,
bone hard like a bottle of beer,

40
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,490
it's going down bone hard from here.

41
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,240
Bone hard like a rocker,
bone hard like a chopper,

42
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,660
bone hard like a bottle of beer,
it's going down bone hard from here.

43
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,570
Bone hard like a rocker,
bone hard like a chopper...

44
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,530
tell someone!
- understood.

45
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,240
(bird chirping)

46
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,330
(Music)

47
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,330
(humming to himself)

48
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,450
(Music)

49
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,950
Good morning, good morning dear sports fans!
Welcome

50
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:03,900
to Werner's sports studio, live and direct
from Kiel's Zwietracht Stadium.

51
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,870
In today's top match
of the Northern Oberliga...

52
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,030
With excellent football weather
the 1st FC Süderbrarup and the hosts

53
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,750
Wooden leg Kiel.

54
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,870
There's a bombastic atmosphere! Around 63,664 spectators

55
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,860
don't want to miss this spectacle. Both teams are in top form.

56
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,070
And there I see the referees!

57
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,530
Helmut! According to § 35 para. ll of the official ordinance,

58
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,780
we have to report before entering large gatherings of people

59
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,950
the proper function of
our service pipes to check!

60
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,110
(Werner) Here the dreaded Helmut Hochbein among the

61
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,400
players, who hardly
hesitates to issue a red card.

62
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,580
In the last cup final he drew
the card without warning when a

63
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,740
goalkeeper bricked up his
goal with 400er Ytong stones.

64
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,410
In professional circles he
is also called "Red Helmut".

65
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,570
The referees check
the correct fit of their

66
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,490
clothes one last time. It
can't be long until kick-off.

67
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,240
I'll take another look in the bottle,
what time it is. Yes... Now it's so far!

68
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,660
Referee Helmut Hochbein sets to kick off. There

69
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,330
seem to be problems. I can't quite make out what it is. Aha,

70
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,070
The referee has a clogged pipe. 
 We are using this delay

71
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,240
and checking the air pressure of the ball again.

72
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:37,280

Second attempt: Bruno Koslowski,  
Kick-off!

73
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,250
Yes, my dear viewers, the ball is released!

74
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,950

Kick-off from Süderbrarup with
a  
powerful shot by Jens Jensen!

75
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,110

Header by Petersen. Parried!
H
eading duel in midfield.

76
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,280

Who jumps higher? Of course
Langmann.  
Cross to Bernie Blindman.

77
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,440

The man with the foresight.  
The
dribbling king of the Holstein team.

78
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,740

Here you see again: The Kiel team
manager  
proved to have a good nose.

79
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,910

For a crate of sprats from
I
nter Milan away! Look at it:

80
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,240
No sprat too many, I would say. The
defense of Süderbrarup is on point!

81
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,410
She rolls from behind across the
field, and attention... Goal! Goal!

82
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,160
Unstoppable! Goal! 1:0 for Süderbrarup.

83
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,200
Unstoppable for Kiel goalkeeper
Würger. But he complains about offside.

84
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,950
Should this beautiful
goal perhaps be invalid?

85
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,370
No, the referees remain strict.
- What is the ball doing in my plants?

86
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,150
(Werner) Kick-off
Kruse. A strong kick!

87
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,700
But there... Hand! Hand! Handball in
the penalty area of 1st FC Süderbrarup!

88
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,410
Who's making such nonsense
here? (Werner) Quite clear: The referee

89
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,580
awards a penalty kick!
- Eckat, come on! We have to go to Hansen's

90
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,740
the heating off... (Werner)
Shot and... Toä! Toä!

91
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,660
Toä. It's unbelievable. Yessir.

92
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,400
Ice cold transformed. This is
the equalizer for the Kielers. 1 : 1.

93
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,660
The goal scorer from
Süderbrarup is obviously angry.

94
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,820
Ouch! Oh! Ouch, ouch.
This will be a hot game.

95
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,940
Corner!
(Koslowski) The ball is caught!

96
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,530
(Werner) Nasty foul by Karl Greif.
- He was just here.

97
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,740
(Werner) What's the referee doing?
He can't decide on the right ball.

98
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,940
There's great
restlessness in the stadium.

99
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,150
It's like hell broke loose here. That's trouble!
- Damn, where is the ball?

100
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,330
Seems there are inconsistencies.
- Ah, there it is!

101
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,450
Hands off! (Werner) The
referee is arguing with

102
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,120
the Kiel groundskeeper.
Protests in the West Stand.

103
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,320
I think I have everything, Mrs. Hansen.
- I'm still looking for nice melons.

104
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,160
Here. Beautiful watermelons!
- With black spots? Strange!

105
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,030
(Werner) The expert is getting
upset about the condition of the ball.

106
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,700
What? Scrap? You
better tell him that.

107
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,370
Here you go, ma'am. (Werner)
Kick-off Süderbrarup, deflected by timber.

108
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,360
Van der Huub gets
tunneled, but strong counter,

109
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,530
Süderbrarup in possession.
Solid, how this team acts in front

110
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,330
of the opponent's penalty area.
And there: a classic Bogencatcher!

111
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,610
What are the Kielers doing?
Are they sleeping? Great save!

112
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,610
The support in the defense of
Holzbein Kiel: Goalkeeper Klaus Würger!

113
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,780
Great! But the danger is not
over yet. Follow-up shot... Post!

114
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,950
Lucky escape. But the ball
remains dangerous. Still Zittermann.

115
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:41,740
Now he wants to know it! Overhead
kick! Dreamlike! And... Goal! Goal!

116
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:47,160
Goal! Is that even possible?
Klaus Würger can't believe it!

117
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,330
2:1 for Süderbrarup! That's
football, the way we love it.

118
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,070
The referee tries to
bring calm into the game.

119
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,240
But it doesn't seem to be working.
The Kiel players seem annoyed.

120
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,570
Are we on a soccer field or what?
(Werner) Kick-off for Kiel. Kruse again.

121
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,290
Long. Long!

122
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,120
Brettschneider nails the pill
mercilessly to the crossbar!

123
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,280
Header from Karl Tüffelmeier. But
there: the Kielers are back on top!

124
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,030
Thrilling final minutes!
Blindmann. Grenade!

125
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,620
Goal! Goal for Kiel in the
last minute! A deserved draw!

126
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,490
Some players are obviously not happy with the referee's decision.

127
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,660
- There he is, the chicken scarer!

128
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,990
I'll stamp you into the ground!

129
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,190
- Referee Koslowski tries to calm down the agitated players. But it doesn't seem to be working.

130
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,820
The stadium turns into a cauldron.

131
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,820
More and more players try their hand at freestyle

132
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,870
wrestling. Nobody can stay in their seats anymore.

133
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,450
Kruse smashes the ball once more
furiously across the field. Watch out...

134
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,320
The ball has landed in an
uncontrolled danger zone.

135
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,490
The ball has fallen onto the hot pan at the

136
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,540
snack bar. It's getting bigger and bigger! It explodes.

137
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,570
What the hell is that? Come on, runner!
(Werner) The whole market is devastated.

138
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,490
Policeman Bruno whistles hanging from a lamppost, the poultry man

139
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,700
hammers against it and wants to get at him. The referee whistles off the game.

140
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,870
Well folks, it doesn't
look good for the 2nd half.

141
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,690
The locker rooms are on fire,
the goal is wrecked, the Kiel

142
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,870
players are after the referee...
Overall though, a nice game.

143
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,530
Not quite fair, but fine.
I'm already looking forward to

144
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,330
Saturday when I can present you with the 2nd half
. See you then!

145
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,200
We switch back
to the broadcasting center.

146
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,410
(Laughter)

147
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,940
(Speaker) That's Griesgram the Gruff.
Dreadful ruler over the county

148
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,110
of Geiergrab, located in the Debacle Mountains. Vapors of melancholy

149
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,280
hover about the tyrant's brow,
for he suffers from a nasty ailment.

150
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,530
He has chronic laughter muscle cramp.
- Chancellor!

151
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,240
Chancellor. Was that a funny movie?

152
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,160
Your Majesty, I am
somewhat... I am somewhat...

153
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,280
How shall I say? Overwhelmed.
So, the one scene...

154
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,900
Chancellor.
Did we laugh?

155
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,410
Yes, do... No. Your Majesty
did not care for laughter.

156
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,740
Has anyone amused themselves in this round?

157
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,080
The film, my king, the
film was eye-gouging!

158
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,330
I felt quite ill!
I had to ko...

159
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:23,120
That went below the belt!
- All devil's muck! Cheese!

160
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,150
So, at one image I already felt
somewhat queasy, Your Majesty.

161
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,530
There you have it!
- Your Majesty, I...

162
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,400
How dare he?!

163
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,160
- I am not to blame! He gave me a guarantee!

164
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,030
- Who is "he"? And what kind of guarantee are you rambling about? - The creator of this art...

165
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,780
work. The draftsman.
A certain Crumb.

166
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,200
He gave me a guarantee on the film!
Yes! Your Majesty, you heard correctly.

167
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,000
A laugh guarantee!

168
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,950
With a mischievous afterthought. I beg to believe,

169
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,490
Your Grace: This crumb is quite the big shot at home! A blast...

170
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,160
I have had something prepared
with your kind permission.

171
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,990
A cinematic portrait, so to
speak. Is Your Majesty agreeable?

172
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,450
Yes.

173
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,250
Water march!

174
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,950
A film document without equal,
Highness! Shot millions of years ago.

175
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:48,370
And an equally worthy witness
of a momentous historical event.

176
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,410
Our ancestors from the tribe
of Australopithecus will in...

177
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,580
a few seconds cross the threshold from

178
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,620
animal to human-verbal communication!

179
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,030
(Music: ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA)

180
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,280
(Music: ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA)

181
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,820
Ah!

182
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,820
(Chancellor) Right away, Your Majesty,
the time
is ripe for the first human word.

183
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,490
Gleich is it so far. Gleich
vernehmt Ye the first human word!

184
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,580
(Burp)

185
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,200
(Chancellor) The primeval
sound of civilization!

186
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:28,280
Transported into our time,
laid in the mouth of an inconspicuous

187
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,740
comic figure named Werner.
That was the starting shot for a

188
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,910
boom, like the world had never experienced before!
Werner began, life

189
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,940
to turn humanity upside down.
No one was able,

190
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,950
to escape Werner.
He was THE sensation!

191
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,620
Read aloud.
- Always remember:

192
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,860
Don't be stingy with the oil!

193
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,280
Okay.

194
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,610
(Chancellor) Even in the hottest regions
he won over the hearts of the population.

195
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,410
Hold on, hold on!

196
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,910
(African)

197
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,200
(African)

198
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,120
(Chancellor) Even in the coldest environment
Werner played an important role.

199
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,280
Werner assure you that you are telling the truth
and nothing but the truth.

200
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:37,030
Then lick your hand and repeat after me:

201
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,240
Yes, I Werner.
(Burp)

202
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,400
Hereby I baptize you
in the name of Werner.

203
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,450
(Chancellor)
A name long thought extinct

204
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,620
celebrated a legendary comeback.
- Werner? Stand up!

205
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,910
(Chancellor) Even the composers of contemporary

206
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,030
choral music could no longer bypass Werner.

207
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,080
(Everyone burps)

208
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,950
Enough! That's it, stop it now!

209
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,120
When Brösel, the creator of
this Werner, heard about you,

210
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,360
He made his way from distant Hedwig-Holstein,

211
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,360
especially to cheer up Your Majesty.

212
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,110
And here he is!

213
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,530
Welcome, Mr. Brösel!

214
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,950
Moin, moin.
- Oh, he looks good!

215
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,120
(Incomprehensible muttering)

216
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,950
(Brösel) Good morning.

217
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,990
He looked at me.
- He looked at me!

218
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,450
Hi Chief!
- No, Mr. Brösel!

219
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,240
He's standing in front of the king!

220
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,320
- There he is,
in full size.

221
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,290
That snob.

222
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:48,570
Brösel, Your Majesty. Brösel.
- Chancellor! Does he want to lecture us?

223
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,870
This knucklehead then
wanted to teach Us how to laugh!

224
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,240
And?

225
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,030
Did We laugh?
(Incomprehensible muttering)

226
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,950
God forbid, Your Majesty!

227
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,950
No.

228
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:21,450
Dumb and Dumber are dead.
Balduin, the holiday scare: dead.

229
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,440
Heinz Erhardt: also
dead. Karl Valentin: dead.

230
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,780
Buster Keaton: dead. So?
Does he notice anything?

231
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,570
Or does he think, the
plague wiped them out?

232
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,200
Well then! Show
him, what happens to

233
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,950
jokers who are
unable to cheer us up.

234
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,120
(Suspenseful music)

235
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,700
But that's the...
- Him too!

236
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,280
(Otto) Don't tickle!
- Yes, yes! That's him!

237
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,910
(Otto laughs)

238
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,360
He was always my favorite comedian.

239
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,990
Well? Has he noticed properly?

240
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,900
So. We give him...

241
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,990
three days. Should it however
not succeed for him by the

242
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,120
deadline, to make us even
the smallest chuckle, then…

243
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,700
(King) Wilhelm Busch is
dead. Heinz Erhardt: also dead.

244
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,870
Karl Valentin: dead. (Brösel)
Woody Allen... also dead?

245
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,040
His glasses!

246
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,450
Helicopter!

247
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:43,080
(Speaker) He knows: The conditions are bad for

248
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,490
drawing masterpieces. Yes, does he even have a chance?

249
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,660
(Suspenseful music)

250
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,740
If my pot breaks in two,
it doesn't matter to me.

251
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,490
Whether happiness or
glass shatters, what do I care?

252
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:16,080
But if a pencil is
broken, I will crawl over.

253
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,990
To help the breaker, and
what does the speaker say?

254
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,150
So, for humanitarian reasons
this person is certainly not here.

255
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,030
Brösel, be careful!

256
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,160
- You don't have to stand on the block of the bloody woodpecker, you have Brösel, you

257
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,240
the magic pen.

258
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,280
In its middle lies concentrated power! Use it, and

259
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:47,030
I swear to you: The king will piss himself laughing!

260
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,240
But you will be free. So take it.

261
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,070
Hey, hey. Not so greedy, my friend.

262
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:00,240
Nothing is for free not even Death
himself. You have to promise me something.

263
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,910
I have one wish free, otherwise nothing.

264
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,080
- I'll do it! When I get out of here, I'll grant you any wish! - One, my best.

265
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,070
One is enough. But on the sly.

266
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,160
So, what is it? Attention, recording.

267
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,570
Ok, when I get out, I
will grant you one wish.

268
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,830
And this thing works?
- Absolutely, my best!

269
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,570
He has already served Albrecht Dürer! Do you know the hare

270
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,320
with the praying ears? Well! It was drawn with that.

271
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:41,120
Good.

272
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,330
- Watch out, my best. Little tip: Draw a joke from your youth. It always goes down well. The king curls up.

273
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,280
Then!

274
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,360
Good laugh and ... see you soon!

275
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,490
Hey, Zatopek, get excited!

276
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,030
What luck, the master overslept!

277
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,400
Tell me, Werner, does it have to be
that the moped is so loud?

278
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,580
Morning, master. The
muffler fell off. Sorry.

279
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,080
Ah, here comes Eckat.

280
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,070
Eckat. Well? Are you already here too?

281
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,150
Good morning, Mr. Röhrich, half past eight.
- So?

282
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,910
Eckat, my wife isn't
here! I think it's time.

283
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,360
Can you runner go have a look in the
cellar? I think the Russians are there.

284
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,160
I'll do it, boss.

285
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:08,870
And you don't have to tinker with the
moped. You can do that at home too.

286
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,610
Yes, master!

287
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:19,860
Werner? Can you come and take a look
here? Behind you, there's a piece of coal.

288
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,490
Pick that up. And then you can
put it with the others in the cellar.

289
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,660
Yes, master. Well, Eckat?
Have you found the Russians yet?

290
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,700
Since the explosion the other day on the
construction site the old man has a different weapon.

291
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,200
(Telephone)

292
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,990
Sanitary installations, heating construction,
climate and swimming pool technology, Röhrich.

293
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,160
This is Mrs. Hansen speaking.
My heating system is rumbling.

294
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,410
Especially at night when I want to
sleep. And it's leaking too. It's unbearable!

295
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:03,330
Yes, Mrs. Hansen, I understand the problem. I ask you:

296
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,150
Has a sniff piece already been installed with you?

297
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,280
A what?
- A self-acting vent.

298
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,610
In specialist circles
also called a sniff piece.

299
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,740
What?

300
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:21,490
- Yes, I believe, Mrs.

301
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,660
Hansen, I'll stop by with my men. Yes, Eckat! Remember last week?

302
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,780
When he wanted to explain the function of the bolt gun to the masons?

303
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:36,370
Or: Giv me mol her. Not
everyone can keep up with that!

304
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,120
Let me do it.

305
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:46,120
And he is so stupid and
shoots his fins off with the thing!

306
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,200
Ah! My hand! Eckat! Werner!

307
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,490
Eckat! Get a bandage, I'm bleeding to death!
- Ouch! Ouch!

308
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,610
What's going on here? Do
you want to make a fool of me?

309
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,150
Eh... Hello, Mr. Röhrich.

310
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:13,150
There aren't any Russians in the cellar.
- What's this circus here?

311
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,280
Why are you eating my coal?
- Ouch!

312
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,610
Men, you have to go, at
Hansen's in Südergraben.

313
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,410
Put a sniffer in. And
install the washbasin.

314
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,580
And the radiator is
still leaking. Werner!

315
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,450
The IDEAL-Standard basin is upstairs
in the warehouse, you get it now.

316
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,910
Be careful not to break it. Eckat,
get the truck out of the garage.

317
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,620
Yes, master.

318
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,530
Huh? Look here, Eckat.
There's a valve here. You Eckat?

319
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:50,910
Where does this come from?
- We took that out recently.

320
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,120
It still looks good. Is it
not working anymore?

321
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,610
He's still good! Does it have to be
that he rusts around here like that?

322
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:12,450
Werner! Take the wire brush
and make the slider shiny.

323
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,490
Then you put him in storage.
- Yes, master. Great chief.

324
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,160
Did you bring everything?
Then let's go! Werner!

325
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,530
Where are you staying?
- Coming, master, I'm hurrying.

326
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,740
Eckat and Werner. Now listen
to me. When you're with Mrs.

327
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,910
Hansen, please take a look at
the furniture. I know Mrs. Hansen.

328
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,990
She always gets so angry!
(Eckat) Yes, yes, boss.

329
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,160
So, Werner. We'll go up to
Mrs. Hansen. It's on the 4th floor.

330
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,280
You carry the things up.

331
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,490
Hello, Mrs. Gloer.
- Get your feet off!

332
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,780
Yes... should I do
that, Mrs. Gloer?

333
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,280
Come on, Eckat, the day is short!

334
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:18,370
We're supposed to lay a piece of
pipe here at Mrs. Hüpenbecker's.

335
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,400
Hey, you rascals!
Please take your feet off!

336
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,190
Leave me alone, old spinach owl.

337
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,490
Stop! I just mopped!
Just mopped!

338
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,530
Yes, yes, yes!
- Werner!

339
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:43,150
Are we at a bachelor party here?
Just mopped fresh! Everything dirty!

340
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:47,860
The beautiful IDEAL standard basin!
- Can't do anything about it, master.

341
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:52,740
Werner, you're ruining me!
- She's to blame with her scrubbing brush!

342
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,160
Dirt! Dirt! I just mopped!
Is that too much to ask?

343
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:02,110
Want to get your feet moving for a bit? But no!
- Now just shut your beak!

344
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,280
We are in a completely
different predicament, Ms. Gloer!

345
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:11,450
I'll give you something to worry
about! You clean up this mess here!

346
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,620
Ugh! Now be reasonable
for once. Calm down!

347
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,610
Just lie down,
we'll take care of it.

348
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:24,030
Eckat! You fix the leak
on the radiator at Mrs.

349
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,740
Hansen's. I'll get a new
IDEAL-Standard. And Werner,

350
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,530
you clean everything up here again.
- Yes, master.

351
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,780
But properly! First
sweep together, then

352
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,410
mop and then polish
everything sparkling clean!

353
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,860
Yes?
- Good day, Mrs. Hansen. Company Röhrich.

354
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:51,830
Gas, water, shit.
- The craftsmen! Are you here already too?

355
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,990
Well! Isn't the boss here at all?

356
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,700
Well, come in. But
take off your shoes!

357
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:04,570
It's leaking here. I've tried
everything, but it just won't stop.

358
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,740
You hear what your boss said.
Everything has to be sparkling clean again!

359
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:13,740
And I'll check that! It's always
the same with the craftsmen.

360
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,910
Be careful with the carpet! I
put plastic bags down extra.

361
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:21,610
And if you want to
smoke: There's the ashtray.

362
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,780
But be careful with the
curtains. I just washed them.

363
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:29,940
And the heating is freshly
painted. What about the sink?

364
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,830
Shouldn't that have
been done today?

365
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,900
- Mr. Röhrich is on his
way and bringing one.

366
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,110
Here I am! Here are
the other things, Eckat.

367
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,070
Good that you're here, Werner. You
have to hold up here for a moment.

368
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,870
My carpet! Shoes off!
- Good day, Mrs. Hansen.

369
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:59,120
I bring your sink.
- How nice, Mr. Röhrich.

370
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,160
Come with me to the bathroom right away.

371
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,030
That I am Röhrich,
every child knows that.

372
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:13,450
Now we two will first have
a liqueur before we start!

373
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,160
No, I won't!
- Oh, come on, you can have one!

374
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,780
Yes, but...
- Well then. Cheers, Mr. Röhrich.

375
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,110
Cheers!
- And another small one?

376
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,450
Well, okay. Cheers.

377
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:35,070
We can still have one.
- Well, alright. Okay then.

378
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,160
Cheers. That's enough now.

379
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,150
One more, because that's it!
- Yes, if there has to be one more...

380
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,150
But then it's over. Cheers!

381
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,740
No point. After the party comes the
hangover. The screw connection...

382
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,280
is all messed up, you. We
have to drain some water.

383
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,450
Fit a new valve, Werner.
- Well, if you think so, Eckat.

384
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,990
One more!

385
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,280
Were you at the hairdresser's,
Mrs. Hansen? You look so good!

386
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,200
You too, you scoundrel!

387
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,610
Ah! Nanu! How do I look?

388
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,780
I'm embarrassing myself! Hick!

389
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,700
Man, I'm so stupid. (Werner)
You can say that again, Eckat.

390
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,610
Hick!

391
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,910
Eckat, Werner! What's wrong
with you? What are you doing?

392
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,320
Are you ready? Are you drinking?
- No!

393
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:54,660
We can't do anything. The connection
is gone. We need a new valve.

394
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,490
What? That's impossible!
Let me try it!

395
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,750
No, no, no!

396
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:06,360
Give me the pliers!

397
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:12,620
It'll still work, Eckat.
Come on, help me.

398
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,940
Röhrich, I would leave that alone.
- Werner! There's a complete pipe lying there.

399
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,620
We'll use it as an extension.
- Yes, Master.

400
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,740
Come on, Werner!
- If this works out at all.

401
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,610
Röhrich!
- Don't talk nonsense! It will work!

402
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,200
That's tearing off!

403
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,780
- Let's see how this
starts. One, two...

404
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,740
Ah! Eckat!

405
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,790
Help me!

406
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:54,490
Eckat, what's going
on? Call Mrs. Wagknecht!

407
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:59,320
Eckat! What are you doing?

408
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,990
Pull me out of here!
Werner! Help me!

409
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,030
Pull now!
- Eckat! I can't hold on anymore!

410
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,200
Call my wife!

411
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,200
Eckat? Eckat! I think,
we tore off the valve.

412
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,400
Why us?
- I think it was you, master.

413
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:34,610
Men! Do something! If
Mrs. Hansen sees this!

414
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,780
How unpleasant! This is
embarrassing for me. The nice carpet!

415
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,990
The handwheel is stuck! Quickly,
quickly, where's the wrench, men!

416
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:51,030
We can't find it.
The water is so dirty.

417
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,830
Werner! Run runner to the cellar
and let the water out of the boiler!

418
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,240
Who, me?
- And get a few rags!

419
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:06,240
And some stoppers! And don't
forget my rubber boots! Hurry up!

420
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,620
Now the salad is hammered.

421
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,780
Everything is wet now.
- Eckat! Old man, get out of here!

422
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,200
I'm bailing here!
- Hi! Mr. Röhrich!

423
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,820
For God's sake, my apartment!

424
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:42,200
Maybe the old lady has a key!
Come on, come on! Open up now!

425
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,570
What are you ringing for at noon?
- I need the key

426
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,280
to the boiler room.
- What does the hallway look like?

427
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:55,450
Up and down! Should I mop again?
- Yes... No!

428
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,620
But the key…
- That's enough!

429
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,780
The purest Sodom and Gomorrah!

- Hurry up, you nagging goat.

430
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:07,950
Clean up! But suddenly, you good-for-nothing!
- I need a basement heating key!

431
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,780
There's a burst pipe up there
and we have to drain the water!

432
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:15,610
You have to ask for
Biernot on the 1st floor.

433
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,780
Good heavens!
- And who's cleaning the hallway?

434
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,870
What's going on?
- I need the key!

435
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:27,030
Which key?
- Heating cellar.

436
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,660
Why?
- Burst pipe, upstairs at Mrs. Hansen's!

437
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,780
Werner! What are you doing?
Why is this taking so long?

438
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:41,490
He won't give me the key!
- The key, man!

439
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,450
We have a mess up there!

440
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:51,450
Stop! Come here! My toilet is overflowing!
- My wallpaper!

441
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:56,950
Out of the question, you're staying here!
- Leave us alone!

442
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:01,030
We have quite other
problems! Ouch! Let go!

443
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,900
You should let me go!
- First you fix my toilet!

444
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:09,610
Werner! Don't go in the cellar! Help
Eckat! And calm down Mrs. Hansen.

445
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,580
Yes, Master.
- Come here.

446
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:18,570
I flushed my dentures down the toilet.
- We'll take care of that right away.

447
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:22,870
Mrs. Gloer, well? There are still
all sorts of other things in there.

448
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:25,990
Oh, no?
- Oh! I think I got him.

449
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,450
How nice, Mr. Röhrich.
- Well! I'm stuck!

450
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,860
That's terrible!
- My arm! I can't get loose anymore!

451
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:40,660
I'm helping you. What are you doing
then? You're doing everything completely!

452
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,240
Eckat!
- Mr. Röhrich!

453
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,580
Eckat! Werner!
- My toilet!

454
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,320
Werner! I'm stuck.

455
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,160
Eckat, Werner! Where am I?
- My toilet!

456
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,990
Eckat! Where are you?
Eckat, Werner! Report!

457
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,200
Do you guys no longer want to talk to me?

458
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,830
Eckat! Can you take a look? I
have something on my head.

459
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,370
I also have dirt on my mouth,
and nobody tells me anything!

460
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:25,410
(Eckat) He's coming up again.
- Great pumpkin! 5.8 points, I would say.

461
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:30,160
Who hasn't had one yet, who wants to
go again? A small donation for the master!

462
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:34,320
Yes sir, ladies and gentlemen!
Pay attention, here he comes again!

463
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:38,610
What will he show us this time?
Yes! A brilliantly executed mud

464
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:43,410
wrestler in reverse! Applause!
- Is everything alright with Mrs. Hansen?

465
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,900
Have you had lunch yet?

466
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,700
Unbelievable. Him too?

467
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,610
Oh!

468
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,910
Well, what day is
it today, people?

469
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,330
Friday, Your Majesty.
- Ramadan, Your Highness.

470
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:11,370
Ah, what! Father's Day!
- No! Carnival Monday!

471
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:17,610
Because today is
All Saints' Day, you.

472
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:20,280
.. carp, the delinquent
has the last word.

473
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,820
Hey! The last word.

474
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,700
We trample through grain,
we trample through the seed.

475
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:29,950
Hooray, we are becoming
stupid, the state pays for us.

476
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:37,030
(Speaker) Calm down, Crumbs. No panic.
You were sleeping, you had a bad dream.

477
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,200
Now you're awake, boy.
Now face reality.

478
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,080
(Exciting music)

479
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,030
You have visitors, Crumbs.

480
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,070
(Speaker) How could Crumbs
possibly get into that one?

481
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,240
Film producer Gerd Geldhai, also
known as "Kraken" in his circles.

482
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:08,240
Rich and notorious for films
like "Rumble at the Maternity

483
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:12,070
Clinic",
\"Unwilling Gynecologist" and "Phone Book Trucchio".
This man walks over corpses.

484
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,150
Oh, Crumbs. What have
you gotten yourself into?

485
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,910
May I ask what this is supposed to be?
- That's the point.

486
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,950
Schulz!

487
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,830
There, take a look.

488
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:36,990
Well? Can you laugh about it?
- No.

489
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,360
That's a damn fine strip.
Great story. Drawn excellently.

490
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:43,320
Or what?

491
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,660
But under this pressure I
cannot work. Deadline allergy.

492
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:55,860
Brain block. Creep already
nightmares.
- You signed a contract.

493
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,650
Can't we cancel that? Let's just
forget about the whole thing, okay?

494
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,650
Good! So let's forget about it.

495
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,450
I'll give you the contract back.

496
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,740
And you, joker, refund me the money I've

497
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,280
buttered into our dwarf-nose project so far.

498
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:23,490
Too much.
Too much
for a man like you.

499
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,660
to make it so easy to
cut it out of your ribs.

500
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:34,030
I'm turning off the tap for you, my dear.

501
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,280
You'll unfortunately have to move out here.

502
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,240
No more own car.

503
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,160
Your motorcycle? You will no longer have even

504
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,280
the money for a decent pair of shoes in the future.

505
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,650
And now... Tear it up.

506
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:08,160
Smart boy.

507
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,870
And now give it your all.
Come up with something!

508
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,650
I'm also getting some ideas, for example,
that you have a premiere in 4 weeks.

509
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:32,320
(Speaker) Did Crumbs
hear that correctly?

510
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,450
Premiere in 4 weeks? Only
a miracle can help him now.

511
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,410
(Rumpelstiltskin)
Watch out, my best man.

512
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:44,530
Little tip: Draw a comedy from your
youth. That always goes down well!

513
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,820
(Röhrich) Mason, carpenter...

514
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,450
Joiners... And not one
for the sanitary area!

515
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:00,950
Am I supposed to handle the work alone?
No, no! How is this supposed to go on?

516
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,620
I don't know...

517
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,790
Good morning, master!
- Werner!

518
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:17,490
Do you actually know how late it is?
- Sorry, master.

519
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:22,660
My moped wouldn't start. The carburetor.
- It's always something with this crappy moped.

520
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:27,200
Buy yourself a bike! I
couldn't afford that back then!

521
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,070
Eckat is already gone with the
truck, to the construction site.

522
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,780
I'll ride there on my moped.
- Yes, get on with it!

523
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:37,780
(Phone)
Well! So early?

524
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:44,370
Sanitary facilities, heating installations,
climate and swimming pool technology, Röhrich.

525
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:48,580
This is Eckat.
We still need a radiator.

526
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:52,700
10 on 160 on 90. And
the gas canister is empty.

527
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,370
Why? It's brand new! You
must have not turned it off!

528
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,990
Ui, ui!

529
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,820
Werner! Wait!

530
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:12,370
Damn cable! What crap!

531
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,610
Get that thing out!
- Yes, master.

532
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,410
Eckat called. You're supposed to bring
something else along. A gas canister.

533
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:36,110
And a 160 radiator. Get going!
- Yes, Master.

534
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,530
Gas canister.
(Groans)

535
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,320
That's heavy!
Ah!

536
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:11,870
Master?
How am I supposed to get all this?

537
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,740
There's a trailer in the shed.
You put it on there! So, then.

538
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:21,120
No, no, Werner,
he's not with it at all.

539
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,570
He's not exactly new anymore either.

540
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,990
How am I supposed to hook that up? Great! I

541
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,200
asked the boss, and I'm getting a new towbar!

542
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:39,370
Master?
- What else?

543
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:44,240
I have to go to Bicycle
Meier first! I need a towbar!

544
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:48,440
Man, are you stupid! Come
on, I'll get it for you! Werner!

545
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:52,150
Use your brain for
once. You take it like this.

546
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,370
Now look! A piece of welding rod.
And then you wiggle this around like this.

547
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:00,450
That's good then!
- Yes, master.

548
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:04,780
Load the stuff up. You're late.
- Ready, master!

549
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:15,530
Quick, Werner! Now go!

550
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:19,490
You know, I kiss hot. You
know, I burn right away.

551
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:23,400
You know that I always achieve
everything, everything. I am a man.

552
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:26,150
Hey-ey-ey! I am a man!

553
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,620
Oh yeah, remember: I am a man!

554
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:35,240
Why are you treating me like a big child? My kisses

555
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:38,910
burn hotter than the desert wind. I am a man. Hey-ey-ey!

556
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:42,030
I am a man!
Oh yeah, remember...

557
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,330
Awesome! Now it's downhill all
the way to the construction site!

558
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:07,570
My brakes are giving out. Ah!

559
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,200
Just a bit more. Just a bit more. Careful!

560
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,200
A lunatic! Oh, help!

561
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,030
Shit! Ah!

562
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:30,910
(Evil laughter)

563
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:36,450
He's giving Toppy some competition!
- Really strong, you! Nice thing!

564
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,200
5.

565
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,700
8 in the B-note, I'd say.

566
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:53,110
Did you bring beer? - Nope.

567
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:58,320
Then run to the store and get 5 beers and make sure they come up here. The
radiator has to go on the 4th floor. Don't forget to hook up the gas bottle.

568
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:02,070
Yeah. Nope.
- Hurry up, the foreman is coming soon!

569
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,820
Alright, Eckat.

570
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,740
Stuck too deep in the mud. I'll never get this out!
That's going to get me yelled at by the foreman!

571
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:31,540
And I have to get beer, too, otherwise
there will be nagging from Eckat.

572
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:44,360
Damn! Where is that boy?

573
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:49,370
(Sings to himself)

574
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:55,120
Well, well! Eckat!

575
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:01,280
Yes, what's wrong, boss?
- So, are you guys sleeping up there?

576
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:05,110
Make sure the stuff
comes up. (Puffs)

577
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:09,240
Oh right. I actually still
had something planned.

578
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,780
Just hurry up! Eckat is thirsty!

579
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,830
Here Eckat, your beer.
- Did you connect the gas canister?

580
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,990
Gas canister? No, not quite.
- The old man is here! Nothing is done!

581
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,400
How am I supposed to stand now?
- How am I supposed to get this junk

582
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:40,160
into the 4th floor anyway? Somehow
I have to pull the cart out of the mud.

583
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:44,410
Of course! With the crane!
I always wanted to try that.

584
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,410
Push me three crowns over.
- Yeah!

585
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:55,410
How often do I have to tell you, you
drunkards? Don't you understand anything?

586
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:59,660
A thousand times I've told you, you should
wear helmets on the construction site!

587
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:03,830
That's mandatory! Everyone
has to stick to that, clear?

588
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:08,620
Not so easy. Everything
looks easier from below.

589
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:20,910
If a stone falls on your head, what then? For the last time: Helmets on at work!

590
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,160
- Boss?

591
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,280
Yes, what else?
- Up there...

592
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,740
(Unintelligible)

593
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:36,370
Well, not bad, such a helmet.
- Lonely peak.

594
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,660
But original.
- Oh, but that's swinging!

595
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:46,490
Cheers, guys, to the helmets!

596
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,490
Chug this shit!

597
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:54,450
Oh, wrong way.
Now there's a burst pipe.

598
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,870
I'll have that right away.

599
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:03,860
I'm going crazy! What is
this kid doing in my crane?

600
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,200
Okay, up with it.

601
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,830
Oh, that's too hard.

602
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,110
Warsaw!

603
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,240
Oh dear!

604
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,780
Hey guys, look! Old Röhrich!

605
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:33,240
I haven't even wiped yet.
Werner!

606
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:36,360
You're a troublemaker!
- Great performance!

607
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,280
I'm embarrassing myself!
- Oh! I've exposed my master.

608
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:45,530
That's going to cause trouble!
- Werner! How are you putting me here?

609
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:49,320
You can't do that!
- Werner! Come over here!

610
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:52,450
I'm embarrassed! In
front of all these people!

611
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,780
"Werner! You're a troublemaker!"

612
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:07,990
Want a sip?
- What's so funny here?

613
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:12,620
Eckat! I didn't expect that
from you! What a disgrace!

614
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:17,160
That wasn't on purpose!
- Why is your apprentice drinking beer?

615
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,200
I'll help you out! What
about the main line?

616
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:26,780
Are the holes drilled? And the
connections? What am I paying you for?

617
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:32,160
You can do fancy stuff at
home! I need this finished today!

618
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:35,910
I have to go to the construction
management. I'm counting on you!

619
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:39,030
Yes, yes.
- What does "yes, yes" mean here?

620
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,780
\"Yes, yes" means: Suck my dick!

621
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:47,200
You stay here until it's done!

622
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,240
Man, he's in a good mood today!

623
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,910
I'm gonna laugh about this. I'll
continue on my own. I'll get us some beer.

624
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,820
Yeah, Eckat.

625
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,820
Eckat is gone. Finally,
can I make my bomb.

626
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:11,620
There! This plastic bag is just right.

627
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:16,280
So! Schön dicht zwirbeln.

628
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:20,990
Gas and oxygen... That
has to sizzle, it has to.

629
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,780
Werner?
- That's Eckat! What does he want?

630
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:28,900
What is it?
- Come down here!

631
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,150
What now again? I'm coming!

632
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,780
Yes?
- Today we're not working anymore.

633
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:41,580
Over to the Maurers. They're giving a party.
- Yes, but...

634
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:45,410
No buts. As an apprentice
you have to obey.

635
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,370
Yes, Eckat.

636
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,990
Everything has to be finished by
tomorrow. How far are your people?

637
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:59,530
They know.
They're working overtime.

638
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:04,080
I ordered it that way.
- Perfect.

639
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:07,950
If you wait a moment, I'll
see about some pipe sections.

640
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,620
Whether they're enough too.
- Yes, yes. That's fine.

641
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:15,900
Yes! One meter... Äh...

642
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:20,200
One fifty-five...

643
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:25,530
What's that nonsense again?
- I measure 1.26!

644
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,410
Eckat! Werner!

645
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:42,530
Eckat! The Russians are here!

646
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:46,860
Eckat! I want to go home!

647
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:51,740
I have to go to
bed. I can't anymore.

648
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,910
I don't want to anymore.
Eckat, where are you?

649
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:02,870
It's alright, Chief. I'll drive you home.
- Oh, he looks so strange.

650
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:06,330
What's wrong? What happened?

651
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,240
Are you alright, Chief?
- Did I measure incorrectly?

652
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:14,570
This way.
- I didn't want to break anything.

653
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:19,700
Oh dear, that was a
bang. Look at the top floor.

654
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:24,740
Yes, it's completely gone.
- Luckily, tomorrow is vocational school.

655
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,080
(Music)

656
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,540
(Telephone)

657
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,580
(Burp)

658
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:52,780
Brösel! You should learn
to speak proper German!

659
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:57,530
And anyway: Where are your drawings?

660
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:02,280
I don't pay you for pleasure! The drawing studio is waiting for your designs!

661
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:06,450
- I'm on my way to the post office.

662
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:10,030
Everything clear? Goodbye.

663
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,650
Hello!

664
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,870
(Music)

665
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:49,040
(Phone)

666
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:56,620
What? Hot water bottles?

667
01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:01,620
Are you crazy, man?
That doesn't interest me!

668
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,990
You will deliver, is that clear?

669
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:09,490
(Narrator) Now he doesn't have much
time left. Only two and a half weeks.

670
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,160
Should he give up?
- Don't talk nonsense, man!

671
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,910
He won't give up! Listen, Crumbs?

672
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:21,950
(Music)

673
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:28,110
(Gerd) I'm turning off
the tap for you, my dear.

674
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:34,240
Your motorcycle? In the future you won't

675
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:37,360
even have the money for a decent pair of shoes.

676
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,740
(Music)

677
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,860
Ach.

678
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:35,290
Ah!
- Good morning, Mr. Engineer!

679
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,110
Can you register my
new turn signal system?

680
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:43,820
Are you trying to pull a fast one on me? There
are no indicators there! According to the ABE...

681
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:47,740
Nonsense! This is not a
conventional turn signal system either.

682
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:52,320
Here in the middle of the handlebars
the sausage magazine is clipped

683
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:56,820
in, and here a spring mechanism is
activated with the push of a button.

684
01:02:56,830 --> 01:03:00,570
A so-called conservative
sausage blinker.

685
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:06,530
Am I supposed to sign this off?
- Yes, I will accept it.

686
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:09,660
Well then, blink left for me.

687
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,990
Well, what's wrong?
- Tastes a little bland.

688
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:20,530
What about mustard? Is it better now?

689
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:26,740
Better now? Sausage blinker?
Such nonsense! Get out of here, man!

690
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:32,490
Don't you like it? Wait! My turn
signal system is variable, you know.

691
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,610
How about peas and carrots?

692
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:38,790
Or Labskaus?
- No!

693
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:42,330
You don't like that
either? (Unintelligible)

694
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:48,990
Because I still have beetroot
with celery. It also goes well!

695
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:54,200
Leave the premises immediately!

696
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:00,370
No entry?
- No! Not a bean!

697
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:06,870
I also have beans with mixed
vegetables! What do you think of that?

698
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:09,580
No! No! No!

699
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:17,700
Hey, Herbert! What do you want here?

700
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:20,750
- Hello. I have a beer can holder here that I want to get registered. - Forget about it.

701
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:24,990
Is he in a bad mood?
- He's not making any entries today.

702
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:33,780
(Pubs)
Damn TÜV. Always the same.

703
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,610
There was a crazy guy with such handlebars.
- Look there.

704
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:41,780
What kind of exhaust system is that?
- That's not original!

705
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:46,580
And there, the backrest! Neither.
- The footrests either!

706
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:50,950
Those are forbidden!
- Not bad, your beer can holder.

707
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,860
My point!
- Should I tell you something?

708
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:59,740
These TÜV guys are just
not quite right. Zero checking.

709
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:03,570
Do you want a sausage?
- Let's go, dude.

710
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:10,080
There! Look at it!
- Protective workshop.

711
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,910
I know that.
- Here, Günna! The slob!

712
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,200
Unbelievable!
- Unthinkable!

713
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,530
And there?

714
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:25,070
Dieter! Dieter! I'm stuck!
Hey, look.

715
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:30,910
The handlebars!
- Dieter, come on, pull!

716
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:35,820
That is just catastrophic!

717
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:43,240
Hey, you guys! Don't mess around like that!
- Install a beer can holder instead.

718
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:48,150
They don't comply with the regulations!
- They should be taken off the road!

719
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,280
Both of them!
- What? Taken off the road?

720
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:08,110
That won't work, it's illegal!
That's what a motorcycle looks like!

721
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:13,440
What? Original junk?
That's how it should be!

722
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:20,530
What? Chopper? Not with
us! Sharp edges everywhere!

723
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:25,530
Those guys are ripe for the slammer!
- Now I've had enough!

724
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:28,280
Something's wrong with you!

725
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:34,360
Through the bars with
bittersweet chocolate! Ha!

726
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,110
Into a Won with marzipan!

727
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:45,910
That way they won't get a license plate!

728
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:53,610
It's no use with them, Herbert.
- I told you so!

729
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,200
Long over there!
- Off we go! Get lost, the shit!

730
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:02,190
Nice thing, you!

731
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,870
- Still tastes good, the booze.

732
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,830
(Rock music)

733
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:47,040
(Brakes squealing)

734
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:57,070
(Speaker) And I also
say: \"Crumbs", I say...

735
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:01,870
Well, that's it then. The
final end for the Werner film.

736
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,120
(Music)

737
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:29,080
(Speaker) It's no use. You have
to try again. Don't give up, old man!

738
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,200
Gather your last creative reserves!

739
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:37,110
Well, Mr. Brösel? How
are we doing today?

740
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:41,030
Oh, much better, I can see that.

741
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:45,740
You shouldn't try so hard!
- Hey! I have to let my film...

742
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:48,450
Stay nice in there.

743
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,080
(Music)

744
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:18,360
(Speaker) What a smoker's leg can
be good for! The doctor keeps that quiet.

745
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:22,070
But what the hell. There are
more important things here.

746
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:29,450
(Music)

747
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:52,700
Good morning, Mr. Wernersen! Wash! Brush

748
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:55,700
and soap in the morning, increase well-being!

749
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:03,830
Nice to wash-wash! Ei, ei, where is he?

750
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,370
Very clear.

751
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:16,240
Okay, nice to brush your
teeth. And wipe your mouth!

752
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,200
So, now measure the fever.
And keep it nicely in your mouth!

753
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:27,620
Bye!

754
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:34,860
Light left on. Old bitch!
(Groans)

755
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:51,740
(Music)

756
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:00,650
Make the bed! Pillows! Blanket!

757
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:06,030
What's going on again?
- Mattress! All messed up!

758
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:13,700
Everything full of cookie
crumbs! Such inconsideration!

759
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:20,400
The same theater every morning!

760
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:25,910
That mustn't be true!
The light left on again.

761
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:27,780
Off! End!

762
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:34,450
(Music)

763
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:39,990
Good morning!

764
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,660
Well? Haven't you peed at all?
- What do you think the toilet is for?

765
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:49,240
- So, so! You know
damn well that you

766
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:54,320
are not allowed to get up!
- Take the bottle and piss off!

767
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:56,410
What?
- Old toad!

768
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:00,240
That's an impertinence! I'll
tell the chief physician that!

769
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:06,360
Am I in a madhouse?

770
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:12,120
Good morning! For breakfast:
a glass of juice or milk?

771
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:18,490
I want my peace! Turn off the
light, or I'll bite the lamp off here!

772
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,660
Ah!

773
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:27,780
That's it!
- What does that guy think he is?

774
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:32,190
The patient has a choleric
attack. Nurse Gertrude,

775
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:35,410
the sedative injection!
- Yes! At your command!

776
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:39,990
This will be a dose of
Spirulina sulfate! Hah!

777
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:45,580
For such rebellious behavior
an enema is also due!

778
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:50,490
(Music)

779
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:02,030
No! Oh!
I just want to sleep peacefully!

780
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:08,490
Elfriede!

781
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:18,610
Yes!
- I hope we have understood each other.

782
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,160
The visit will be carried out
with the utmost concentration.

783
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,280
Yes, Professor.
(Screaming)

784
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:36,240
My last beer reserves!
- Where is the bean wax?

785
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,110
He'll see what he gets!

786
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,780
Ah! Help!

787
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:58,030
Well then, let's see
what it looks like here.

788
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,750
At the next pati...

789
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:09,570
(Sings) La Paloma ohe!

790
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,120
There comes a time when it has to end.

791
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:19,200
Come on, sister? Always
bring out the enema! Goodbye!

792
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:22,070
Ah!

793
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:35,740
Always these drug-addicted
doctors. Ah, an outboard motor! Ahoy!

794
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:40,990
(Humming to himself)

795
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:57,320
Moin, Werner!
- Hello, Andi!

796
01:14:57,330 --> 01:15:01,490
They've got something wrong upstairs
here. Just make sure we get out of here!

797
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:06,370
Let's get out of here then.
- You'd better do that, man. Give it some gas, dude!

798
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:09,110
Yeah, let's go!

799
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:14,690
Where to?
- Let's have a party!

800
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:18,870
We're going to the beach, pumping booze.

801
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:22,660
- Yeah, then put in the party diskette! - Okay, I will!

802
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,700
(Music)

803
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,110
Yay!
Into a boat with marzipan!

804
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:41,200
Hey guys! Look up there! Booze!

805
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:46,320
I think,
Werner is out of the hospital.

806
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:50,490
He's definitely going to give you one, you.
- I think that's good, you!

807
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:55,080
Let's have one ourselves.
- That's a good idea, you!

808
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,740
You know, I kiss hot. You
know, I'm burning right away.

809
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:05,110
You know that I always achieve
everything, everything. I am a man.

810
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,660
Hey-ey-ey! I am a man!

811
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:12,480
Oh yes, remember: I am a man!

812
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:18,240
Why are you treating me like a big child? My kisses

813
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:22,030
burn hotter than the desert wind. I am a man. Hey-ey-ey!

814
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:27,990
I am a man!
Oh yes, remember: I am a man!

815
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,910
Werner! Ey!

816
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:39,410
(Screams)

817
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:48,830
Hi Werner! Everything
okay! We're tapping a keg!

818
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:53,030
Look.
He's not back on the steamer yet.

819
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:56,030
Let him crack up first.

820
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:00,830
What a tough time. They even
took his last beer reserves from him.

821
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:03,990
You're not saying. - Because it was time for him to be back with us.

822
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,610
- I know what helps him!

823
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:11,780
A really strong coffee! Come
on! Throw your bowl at me!

824
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,110
Yeah, good idea! That's really good.

825
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,240
(Rocksong: LET'S DANCE)

826
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,490
Turn it down a bit. Give it here!

827
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,120
(Rocksong: LET'S DANCE)

828
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:29,780
Flathead is in the mood!
- Hooray!

829
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:37,570
(Narrator) No, we are not dreaming: Premiere!

830
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:41,370
Actually premiere for the Werner film! Brösel made it.

831
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,290
(Singing LA PALOMA)

832
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,740
Hello, boss! Two beers
with strawberry yogurt!

833
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,360
18, 20...
- Yes.

834
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:03,160
2, 3...
- At least.

835
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:06,040
4?
- Logical.

836
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:10,000
21 .644!
- Wech.

837
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,700
21 .648!
- Weg!

838
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:19,370
I play cross-hand, point on
Visit black to table and chair.

839
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:21,450
Contra!
- Re.

840
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:23,540
Deer.
- Elk!

841
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:26,450
Asshole!
- I'm out.

842
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:30,320
Very good.
- I'll take that one!

843
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:37,450
Well, finally! There it is!
Strawberry yogurt! Cheers, Werner!

844
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:41,450
Comes well in the morning!
Get outta here, the shit!

845
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:48,740
Do you know what's even better?
- Nope!

846
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:53,860
(Both) Sugar egg!
- Yeah, boss! We want two sugar eggs!

847
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:57,070
Yeah, that's better.
- Sugar egg? Uh...

848
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:02,280
Doesn't stand on the menu. What is that?

849
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:06,620
- You take a glass, pour in two, three yolks and stir it with sugar!

850
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:13,280
What's he thinking? Fried, or what? Something
like that! Don't know what sugar-egg is!

851
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:16,330
Stabbed!
- Come on, pants runner!

852
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:22,780
No! Card runner!
- Lay it open on the table.

853
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:25,780
Let's go. I'm out.

854
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:29,570
I can beat her! You have to take over.

855
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:38,910
Take over. You have to
take over. Not hand over!

856
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,860
Ah, okay.

857
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:47,370
Wait a minute. With 3,
play 4, Hand 5, Tailor 6...

858
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:53,450
Ah! What is that supposed
to mean? Should I puke?

859
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:00,240
Tell me, old man, don't you have any mix-up?
- Do it yourselves!

860
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:03,280
I can't handle this.

861
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:06,330
(Rock music)

862
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:10,490
(Screaming)

863
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:19,910
Come on, folding chair! I'm thirsty!

864
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:24,200
Uh, yes... Wha... wha...
what would you like?

865
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,820
Juice.
- Juice!

866
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:28,940
Juice!
- Juice.

867
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:31,700
Juice!
- Juice!

868
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:34,820
Have you heard? Sixmo juice!
- Uh...

869
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:39,320

Apple or...
- Yes! All
banana, you plum!

870
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:44,570

We also have B... pear.
- Boo!

871
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:49,860

I don't like to say
this twice:
I want juice!

872
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,110

That's fine! Then I'll make pineapple!

873
01:21:56,870 --> 01:22:02,070

What?
You want to get Anna wet?

874
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:07,950

If anyone here gets
Anna wet,
then it's me!

875
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,820

Do you know that?

876
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:15,240

W... why?
- I'll shove the
pear up your ass, you rat!

877
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:21,110

I'm saying this will be fun.

878
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:31,400

I hear something.
- I
don't hear anything.

879
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:34,580

Do you have to say
something?
- Oh! 18.

880
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,440

Yeah.
- 20.

881
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:39,700

Yeah.
- Dude, from the field!

882
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:44,150

Buy yourself a mix tomorrow, you.

883
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,910

Yeah, that's better.

884
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,530

Get lost, this shit!

885
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:55,330

50.
- I have it.

886
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,410

55.
- I have that too.

887
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:12,620
(Burps)

888
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:17,490
(Farts)

889
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:33,450
(Exciting music, screams)

890
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:59,160
Hello, my little one!
- I'm going crazy. You?

891
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:04,410
But it was just a dream!
- Oh come on! A dream?

892
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:09,820
And this beautiful sound recording?

893
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:14,660
\"Okay. When I get out of
here, I will grant you a wish."

894
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:17,780
And the king?
- He didn't laugh.

895
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:22,660
No? Didn't he laugh?

896
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:29,030
Would you have even scratched a single
line without me? And in the hospital?

897
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:33,280
Okay, okay. Convinced. So,
what's it about? What do you want?

898
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:39,070
My motorcycle? You can have it.
- No, no. Nothing so valuable.

899
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:43,820
I just want you.
- Huh? Me?

900
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,110
Yes! I want to marry you!
- Marry?

901
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,290
(Music: TREULICH GEFÜHRT)

902
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:18,580
As Schopenhauer says:
Rights halve and duties double.

903
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:23,950
So are you, Rötger F. Brösel, so... ready, to have

904
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:28,030
this woman standing next to you with the name...

905
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:33,030
äh... name... Well?
What are we called again?

906
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:37,990
You, I think she's from the home.
She doesn't even know her own name.

907
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,160
Well, what am I called then?
You may guess three times.

908
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:45,570
So tell us your name.

909
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:55,990
Ah, how good that no one knows
that my name is Rumpelstilzchen.

910
01:25:56,410 --> 01:26:00,530
Then I am forced to
give you a little help.

911
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:03,660
Your name isn't Alf, is it?
- No.

912
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:07,360
Steffi Graf?
- Never!

913
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:12,030
Well, am I wrong in assuming that
your name is something rather unusual?

914
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:16,200
Have you heard the name Rumpelstiltskin?

- The devil told you that!

915
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:18,400

Ah!

916
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:28,820

I am redeemed.
- A miracle!
Thank you, sir! Yeah!

917
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:31,740

(Music: HALLELUJAH)

918
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:42,330

My name is recognized.
-
The curse is now lifted.

919
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:47,570

Now things are getting pleasant.
I
want to see a beer right away!

920
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:51,370

Hallelujah,
I'm opening
a bottle of beer.

921
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:55,740

We're getting married today,
which
I'll celebrate with a drink.

922
01:26:56,660 --> 01:27:00,410

Hallelujah,
I'm opening
a bottle of beer.

923
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:05,160

This will be a great
party,
we'll have another one.

924
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:08,030

A miracle has
happened,
I saw it exactly.

925
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:11,410

A miracle came true at
the altar.
That can't be.

926
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:14,860

Hey man, say
"No"!
First have a beer.

927
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:19,030
He looked at me! She
already feels like a rocker chick.

928
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:22,070
He looked at me.
- He looked at me!

929
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:26,370
Will someone ever understand women?
It's going down tonight, but just barely.

930
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:31,030
That's our way, we like it hard. Get
out, whether it's a Pils or a wheat beer.

931
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,410
We love booze!
I'm into any beer.

932
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:37,190
Hallelujah, I'm
opening a bottle of beer.

933
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,900
We're getting married today,
which I'll celebrate with a drink.

934
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:46,450
Hallelujah, I'm
opening a bottle of beer.

935
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:51,110
This will be a great party,
we're having another one.

936
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:55,860
It's about time, man, I'm
drunk. There's just one little thing

937
01:27:55,870 --> 01:28:00,690
missing, then I'll be completely
wasted. Hey, sweetie, are you my wife?

938
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:03,240
I just asked!
Romance is in the air today.

939
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:05,410
You're standing on my
foot, come, give me a kiss.

940
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:07,650
Get lost, you shit, whether
she's black or white.

941
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:10,120
Whether blond or brown,
we all love women.

942
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:13,910
Hallelujah,
I'm opening a bottle of beer.

943
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:18,610
We're getting married today,
which I'll celebrate with a drink.

944
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:22,910
Hallelujah,
I'm opening a bottle of beer.

945
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:27,660
This will be a great party,
we'll have another one.

946
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,620
(Phone)

947
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:48,400
What's up?

948
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,030
Why aren't you at work,
Crumb?

949
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:58,110
I have the option
for part two!

950
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,290
What?

951
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:12,160
Oh, man. What do you mean?
Let's just put in another hour.

952
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:22,780
There's only one thing
left to do: open a keg!

953
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:33,200
Hard as a rocker,
hard
as a chopper,

954
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:39,700
hard as a bottle of
beer,
hard it goes from here.

955
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:46,360
Hard as a rocker,
hard
as a chopper,

956
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:53,110
hard as a bottle of beer,
it
goes down hard from here.
