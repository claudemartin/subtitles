1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,949
(Bird chirping)

2
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,077
(Woodpecker drums)

3
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,753
(Humming)

4
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,954
(Owl hoot)

5
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,357
(floaty punk rock)

6
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,678
(Pneumatic hammer)

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,397
Good morning, Mrs.
Pasternak. You look delicious.

8
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,279
-Little slimeball.
-Thanks for the coffee,

9
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,398
I made potato soup.
You do it in the basket.

10
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,834
Great!

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,355
Hi. Only good news allowed.

12
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,999
Yes, as always.

13
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,231
-Good morning, neighbor.
-Morning.

14
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,674
(Baby gurgles)

15
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,151
There’s the little
screamer, too.

16
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,799
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

17
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,950
(loudly) Boo!

18
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,317
Hey, what's that supposed to
mean? Are you crazy, or what?

19
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,350
-Being startled always helps me.
-With hiccups, you idiot. Asshole.

20
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,431
-(Man) Mornin', fuzzball, -Are
you getting everything wet?

21
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,238
Yeah, all good, dude.

22
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,153
-Hey, Fussel, -Yeah.

23
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,755
-Fang.
-You're the best,

24
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,434
For you, dude. Enjoy your meal.

25
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,473
(soothingly) Yes...

26
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,391
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

27
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,437
Man, that's cute.

28
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,193
-I think that's awesome.
-What do you think is awesome?

29
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,953
That you’re buying meat.

30
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,634
Most amazing women,
are vegan, you know.

31
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,316
So tense tofu aunts, That's
not for us, right, Durutti?

32
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,470
Oh, Durutti,

33
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,031
The leader of the anarchists
in the Spanish Civil War.

34
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,397
Don't talk rubbish, do you
know Buenaventura Durruti?

35
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:58,159
It was… (she clears
her throat) 1896 to 1936.

36
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,789
I study political science.

37
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,193
Carnivore and also intelligent.
Do you perhaps have a sausage?

38
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,350
Yes.

39
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,316
-Come here.
-Maybe one more for the dog?

40
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,673
Come here, Durutti,

41
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,878
Hammer lady, hm? I've got this.

42
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,436
-Yes, I'm already home.
-Ah. It was very nice to meet you.

43
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,911
-Yes, me too. Take care.
-You too.

44
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,593
-Bye.
-See you then.

45
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,273
(Mrs.) Adonis!

46
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,391
Adonis!

47
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,634
Little Adele,

48
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,279
You're called Adonis? Awesome.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,559
Adonis.

50
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,757
I have him! I have him.

51
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,194
Thank God.

52
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,192
There you are, my dear Adilein.

53
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,557
The mistress was so worried.

54
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,350
Came towards me. Then I
thought, that one has escaped.

55
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,319
-Good thing you were there.
-No problem.

56
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,834
Thank you. Wait.

57
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,510
-Here, -That isn't necessary.

58
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,437
Tie it tighter next time.

59
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,594
-Good morning.
-Morning.

60
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,120
Hello.

61
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,954
Mr. Poschka, come
with me right away.

62
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,238
No! I've been waiting for
two hours. It's my turn now.

63
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,154
That is an internal
process. Come here.

64
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,960
Dude, you're off,
Relax for once.

65
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,919
Go to a meadow, run through it.

66
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,636
We have a problem.
We have an internal audit.

67
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,920
There are some controllers in the
house. There's one standing there.

68
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,272
-Don't look so obviously.
-Crazy,

69
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,159
And now they are checking
the long-term customers,

70
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,754
and in your case…

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,195
Why, what is it?

72
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,638
They receive welfare benefits, well,
since welfare benefits have existed.

73
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,435
And before that...

74
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,076
I know your private situation,
and I fully understand.

75
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,629
I mean, you know
that too, right?

76
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,872
With all that you
accomplish, that is…

77
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,474
unbelievable.

78
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,150
Mrs. Linde,

79
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,949
You are my rock
in the raging sea.

80
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,478
They have my back. For
the really important things.

81
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,238
Glad to hear it. How
is little Ali doing?

82
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,198
Hm? Oh, I see.

83
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,555
That’s tough.

84
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,873
They have now diagnosed
him/her/them with Tourette's syndrome.

85
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,394
What?

86
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,393
Refugee child,
and now this, too.

87
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,871
Luckily, no one understands him
when he rants and raves in Afghan.

88
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,238
The mother addicted to
pills, the father never there.

89
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,074
I am the big brother,
the one he never had.

90
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,277
His is on the pressure plate…

91
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,478
What? That's terrible.

92
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,674
Yes.

93
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,349
Quite dreadful. (clears throat)

94
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,869
Yes...

95
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,114
This can’t go on like this.

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,673
You need to take action.

97
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,871
Yes, active.

98
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,113
(passionate moaning)

99
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,836
-Everything okay? Yes

100
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,549
No.

101
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,194
Why not?

102
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,319
I am pregnant.

103
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,590
(Fussel laughs)

104
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,830
No, really. Really, now.

105
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,517
But you couldn't
possibly know that yet,

106
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,320
Not by you. I’m
three months along.

107
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,589
Ah...

108
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,157
Is that a problem for you?

109
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,994
No. I can live with that.

110
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,037
(Punk rock)

111
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,309
Oh, fuck.

112
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,155
Come on, man!

113
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,280
-Keys lost.
-Idiot.

114
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,029
(Fussel) I got this letter
from the pension scammers,

115
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,271
They want to know
every single thing.

116
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,796
Yesterday, "Unsettled Times".

117
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,635
What I did from August
1991 to February 1994.

118
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,317
‘91… I only have completely
blurred memories.

119
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,597
What business is
it of theirs, anyway?

120
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,558
They are coming to the clinic.

121
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,869
Huh?

122
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,999
An absolute emergency. A
miracle that went so quickly.

123
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,312
They want to make
an example out of you.

124
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,633
Cut off all allowances,
everything. Rent, health insurance.

125
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,998
They have me in their sights,
disciplinary investigation.

126
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,552
-Man, they accuse me of having thrown you...
-What kind of clinic?

127
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,714
I told them what a
selfless person you are.

128
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,952
Yes -That didn't help.

129
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,236
Also, my brother-in-law
is a psychiatrist,

130
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,189
He has been initiated and
written a certificate for you.

131
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,352
You will be admitted
to therapy immediately.

132
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,080
He secured a place
in a beautiful clinic.

133
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,197
Mrs. Linde, what
are you talking about?

134
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,114
-From burnout.
-Burnout?

135
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,192
You have a burnout.

136
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,193
Six weeks of inpatient stay.

137
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,717
and then a medical certificate
of incapacity for work.

138
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,954
Stationary? Mrs. Linde,
I’m not good in captivity.

139
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,874
You know what
burnout is, Mr. Poschka?

140
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,189
Please, you can
find information there.

141
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,159
It must be. We're all
in the same boat now!

142
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,200
Oh God, here he comes.

143
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,790
Oh, the legendary Mr. Poschka.

144
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,193
Mr. Poschka?

145
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,631
(Punk rock)

146
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,157
(Punk rock transitions
into quiet guitar sounds)

147
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,511
-That must be the new one.
-I've got this.

148
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,199
Good morning.

149
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,589
Welcome to the Berghoff
Clinic... Mr. Poschka.

150
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,119
Our reading room.

151
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,911
-Common room.
-Do you have Sky?

152
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,992
-Please?
-Because of football.

153
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,833
Or is there a pub around here?

154
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,590
-Um...
-That's okay.

155
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,672
Our patients should
not leave the grounds.

156
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,275
How now? Are we
prisoners? Is this a gulag here?

157
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,039
(with accent) "You can take
everything from me, but not my freedom."

158
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,035
Please be a little
careful with the jokes.

159
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,760
not only in the
interest of the patients.

160
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,912
My grandfather was
murdered in the Gulag.

161
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,116
Oh, sorry. I didn’t
mean to do that.

162
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,594
Mr. Wagner?

163
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,793
That is your new
roommate, Mr. Poschka.

164
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,359
Hi.

165
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,034
You can call me
Fussel, everyone does.

166
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,719
(distressed) Man,

167
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,751
Günth... (he clears
his throat) Günther,

168
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,276
Prof. Dr. Gunst will conduct
the introductory meeting with you.

169
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,838
Dinner is at six.

170
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,150
At six? (Door closes)

171
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,592
Isn't that more
of a brunch, then?

172
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,311
Does it bother you if I smoke?

173
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,594
Stinks.

174
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,594
(sighing) Okay.

175
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,436
-(Mann) The bladder protects
you., -(Frau) I can’t do that.

176
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,877
-(Man) Just let go.
-(She sobs)

177
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,350
(Anleiterin) In
stillness lies the power.

178
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,275
(sobbing) I can't do
that. I can't do that.

179
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,034
(Mann) Yes, you
can. You can do it.

180
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,590
-(Man) How lovely,
a new one, -Hi.

181
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,990
Hi. I am Datty.

182
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,234
-I am Fussel, -Fussel? Cute.

183
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,516
(Snuffling sounds)

184
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,718
And who are you?

185
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,520
(Puppe) Fuck you,
you spaz. He's mine.

186
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,638
Excuse me, he’s in a
really bad mood today.

187
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,189
Hey. (quietly) Pull
yourself together.

188
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,229
We both said, that we
need more freedom, hm?

189
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,399
I'm just kidding,

190
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,551
That is my job.
Puppeteer for children,

191
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,076
Perhaps you've heard of
them? Datty and the Dateheads.

192
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,190
No,

193
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,358
Among the little ones, I
am one of the big ones.

194
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,591
Okay. Mhm.

195
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,274
We'll see each other, won't we?

196
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,911
(Doll) But he has a great ass.

197
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,314
(Geese honk)

198
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,311
(Birdsong)

199
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,830
(loud quacking)

200
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,440
No. That’s because you
used the wrong detergent.

201
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,750
He always gets
those red pimples.

202
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,480
And when Jonas has
his German test tomorrow,

203
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,110
then slip a glucose
tablet into his lunchbox.

204
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,477
Don't forget, that Kira tomorrow
at half past three to the...

205
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,551
Oh, yes, yes of
course. I have to as well.

206
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,993
So then, I… I love…

207
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,193
Yes, goodbye.

208
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,874
-(Rustling)
-(she startles) Oh God.

209
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,919
Sorry. I thought, here
cell phones are prohibited.

210
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,996
Oh, I see. No. Yes.

211
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,470
Don't tell on me, please.

212
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,234
That was my family,
I have to go to them...

213
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,869
Also, they can’t
manage on their own.

214
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,680
There are so many things.
The washing machine...

215
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,080
Aha.

216
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,795
I am, by the way, Andreas.
But everyone calls me Fussel,

217
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,189
Why?

218
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,955
-What “why”?
-Why do they call you Fussel?

219
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,111
Oh, that’s a nickname
from my school days,

220
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,113
because I had such
sparse beard growth.

221
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,432
You still have the same
nickname from school days?

222
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,113
Yes. Why not?

223
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,269
Yes.

224
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,840
I must.

225
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,314
Okay.

226
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,751
(he exhales heavily)

227
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,593
(thoughtful music)

228
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,234
(loud quacking)

229
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,190
(he screams)

230
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,317
(he splashes into the water)

231
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,314
Old man!

232
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,473
Shit.

233
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,630
(he laughs and cheers)

234
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,439
(loudly) Yes! Yes! Yes!

235
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,319
(Man) Quiet, people
want to sleep here.

236
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,796
(softly) Man, am I stupid?

237
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,109
(he spits)

238
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,716
Also, Mr. Poschka.
Warm welcome to us.

239
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,029
Impressive.

240
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,275
That is really a
very thin patient file.

241
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,829
Dramatic attestation
from the colleague:

242
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,516
Immediate inpatient therapy
strongly recommended.

243
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,275
Yes, but… no history,
no medication.

244
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,351
No outpatient therapies?

245
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,080
I just tried for a
very long time,

246
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,232
to settle my
problems with myself.

247
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,031
I didn't want to burden anyone.

248
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,634
That's just how I am.

249
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,438
So, so. Well then…

250
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,110
1.82 meters, 72 kilograms,
44 years old, single.

251
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,194
Children?

252
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,840
-Hm?
-Oh, a daughter,

253
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,239
I have a daughter.

254
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,356
They just briefly forgot them?

255
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,309
No, I… I was lost in
thought somewhere else.

256
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,872
Concentration problems.

257
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,153
That’s just typical, isn’t it?

258
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,760
Okay.

259
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,474
Mr. Poschka.

260
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,670
How are you doing today?

261
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,311
<i>-Tired.
-Mhm.</i>

262
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,110
Also, more than tired,
Completely exhausted.

263
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,239
Headaches, dizziness,

264
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,476
It... it's just all
too much for me.

265
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,193
Are you allergic to anything?

266
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,511
Yes, for example,
against the AfD.

267
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,312
Sorry, I always get a
little silly when I’m nervous.

268
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,590
No, no allergies.

269
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,590
Closer.

270
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,036
(muffled heartbeat)

271
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,200
(Flashlight beeps)

272
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,193
-Drugs?
-No, thank you,

273
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,514
The joke is old.

274
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,036
But they smiled briefly.

275
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,359
(A rooster crows)

276
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,589
Good morning.

277
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,674
(Fussel groans)

278
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,590
(Doctor) We have a new arrival.

279
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,752
Warm welcome, Mr. Poschka,
here in our little club.

280
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,470
Do you want to tell me
something about yourself?

281
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,753
Mr. Poschka?

282
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,554
Huh?

283
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,429
We would like to
get to know you.

284
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,109
Oh 50…

285
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,197
(hesitantly) I would like to…

286
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,040
Maybe someone
else could go first?

287
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,356
Really bad headaches.

288
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,919
Sure.

289
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,078
Is there anything
on anyone’s mind?

290
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,590
Yes, me.

291
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,750
I lay awake the entire night,

292
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,198
because my company has a very
important contract negotiation today.

293
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,831
-(Fussel) Today is Sunday.
-Excuse me?

294
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,793
Today is Sunday.

295
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,950
And you have \"a contract
negotiation on Sunday?

296
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,999
If things were different,
I wouldn't be here now.

297
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,710
(clears throat) So,
anyway, my attorney must

298
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,076
to lead the
negotiation, because I…

299
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,399
I’m not there, you know.

300
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,356
Yes, it concerns
very large properties.

301
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,715
an absolutely essential
transaction for my company,

302
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,829
and I spent almost the entire night
developing negotiation strategies.

303
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,880
I can't turn that off,
it's driving me crazy.

304
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,556
Mr. Lamprecht, how would you
describe the importance of your company?

305
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,631
assess your life?

306
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,918
(He clears his throat)
The company is already…

307
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,150
That is very...

308
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,515
Maybe…

309
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,390
Hm?

310
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,799
Maybe you're just afraid that...

311
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,115
it could come to a good
conclusion even without you.

312
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,196
I know that from my children.

313
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,318
I am always proud, when they
manage something on their own,

314
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,393
and at the same
time, but I am also sad,

315
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,320
that they don’t need
me as much anymore.

316
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,951
Real estate, you say, huh?

317
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,474
Real estate investments,
to be precise.

318
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,358
I run a company…

319
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,558
I’ve always wanted to
know how that works.

320
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,030
Nice that you are
contributing, but...

321
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,272
How can one sell something,
that doesn't belong to them?

322
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,555
What do you mean?

323
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,953
I mean… the Earth,

324
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,350
You didn’t knead
that yourself, did you?

325
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,717
It's just there. We
all live off of that.

326
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,159
Eight billion shoot
me dead people,

327
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,872
And why are there a few
among them who can simply say:

328
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,118
That part of Earth here, from
here to over there, it belongs to me.

329
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,916
Where on Earth did they
get that piece of land?

330
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,629
Bought from the
owner or inherited.

331
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,473
No, you don’t understand me.

332
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,190
That can’t possibly have an
owner. That's common knowledge.

333
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,431
I mean, someday some guy

334
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,989
in the Stone Age, simply put:

335
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,073
My cave., My cave
courtyard. Mine.

336
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,470
That's bullshit, you understand?

337
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,551
He had no right to do that.

338
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,838
And so it went on beautifully,
And now it’s your turn.

339
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,435
Only because your
great-great-great-great-grandmother…

340
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,072
simply grabbed a piece of land
back then, are you now here...

341
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,311
Mr. Poschka. No.

342
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,314
That's like selling
rainwater or wind.

343
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,234
They intend to do
that, the corporations,

344
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,997
What is all this supposed to
be? What is this hippie stuff?

345
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,834
Dude, you’re
selling stolen goods.

346
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,435
That is outrageous!

347
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,355
Hey, that’s so unfair, man!
You are a huge asshole!

348
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,511
(arguing amongst themselves)

349
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,752
(Nurse) Please sit down.

350
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,957
(they are shouting
at each other)

351
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,800
(Splashing)

352
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,192
-(Nurse) Just put it back on.
-(Fussel) Sorry, sorry...

353
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,716
-Excuse me, I think she...
-(Rosi sobs)

354
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,029
(Nurse) Just sit back down.

355
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,918
(Splashing)

356
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,040
Sorry, I was a little heated.

357
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,111
It really pisses me off when things
like that happen. All these crybabies,

358
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,513
And their "First World Problems."
I just can't deal with that much,

359
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,273
It's a symptom of burnout,
outbursts of aggression.

360
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,591
You should actually know that.

361
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,389
I…

362
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,313
The guy earns millions
of thalers with his crap,

363
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,199
and then he bawls, because
that stresses him out so much.

364
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,317
(he imitates crying)
Boo-hoo-hoo.

365
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,959
(softly) Boo-hoo,

366
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,717
The machine will just crush
you. You brought it on yourself.

367
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,072
And you are here because…

368
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,278
Your therapist wrote:

369
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,432
Exaggerated emphatic feeling.

370
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,954
Yes, that shit really
breaks my heart,

371
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,515
Hm... The carrots... Yes.

372
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,276
Hm... No carrots.

373
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,473
Potatoes, yes.

374
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,600
Although… No.

375
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,358
I’m not hungry at all.

376
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,673
(she groans annoyed)

377
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,239
Next.

378
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,877
Hello, I’ll take these
chicken nuggets and noodles.

379
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,158
(A ringing in the ears
begins) Everything okay?

380
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,834
-Hey, hey.
-It has to go, it has to go.

381
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,595
Mrs. Gröning, don't hit.
Don't hit her in the ear, okay?

382
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,037
-What does she have?
-Tinnitus, it’s always there.

383
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,955
(Gröning) It is always there.
It is always there. Always.

384
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,358
I'll take another
plate, meatball,

385
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,793
Calm down, a few more.

386
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,838
I love this stuff. Thanks,

387
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,719
I have the chicken
nuggets and noodles for you.

388
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,318
<i>Are you okay?
- Mhm.</i>

389
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,394
Enjoy your meal.

390
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,234
Hi.

391
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,632
Where is your shrink?

392
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,195
With electroshock therapy.
There's no other way.

393
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,832
Is that kind of shit real?

394
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,149
Small joke.

395
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,559
Here, all they do
is talk, talk, talk.

396
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,597
And a little gymnastics.

397
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,512
Gymnastics is voluntary.

398
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,320
Why are you here?

399
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,552
I mean, you're perfectly
normal. Except for that doll.

400
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,713
Well, it is tiring, constantly
working with children.

401
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,678
Arno, I didn't say that,

402
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,640
It was agreed, that we
would all make the decisions,.,

403
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,598
Now it is.., Hello?

404
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,593
(in a high voice) What, you’re
leaving? You want to do your own thing?

405
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,310
(with a deep voice)
Yes, I want to evolve,

406
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,756
Butterfly. Metamorphosis,

407
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,718
What meta?

408
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,553
(deeply) To pupate,

409
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,874
(high) Fuck dolls,
Stay here, with me,

410
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,671
(softly) Hey, hey. Get lost.

411
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,031
Hey, hey, hey. Don't
touch Schnurpsi. Leave him,

412
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,714
Don't touch it,

413
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,157
Leave your damn
fingers off my doll!

414
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,880
A few things came
together back then.

415
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,714
Tax audit, private crap,

416
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,438
(Screams)

417
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,238
I probably overreacted a bit.

418
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,359
(he roars with all his might)

419
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,478
I don’t know if I can
ever do that again.

420
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,190
And what's left for me
then? I have nothing else.

421
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,558
Get a really good night’s
sleep, then you’ll be alright again,

422
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,794
Does it taste good?

423
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,357
(electrical humming)

424
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,714
Did I fall asleep?

425
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,999
Two hours.

426
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,519
(yawning) I... I’ll soon
be one of you here,

427
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,398
Why are you crying
again? What’s wrong?

428
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,437
(Datty) He does that sometimes.

429
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,999
Awake, burned-out
ones of this earth!

430
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,073
You need more power.
You are elevator music.

431
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,549
More Sex Pistols!

432
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,438
(floaty punk rock)

433
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,635
Come!

434
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,355
Yes, come on, hop, hop! Come
on! You here too, you yoga rejects,

435
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,190
Günther, come.
This is not voluntary.

436
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,394
Come on.

437
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,280
Come on, back there!
Come, come, come!

438
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,838
Hop, hop! Go!

439
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,037
Get up, you pill-poppers!

440
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,953
Hey. You are still with
us. You go over here.

441
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,635
-Shall we play offside?
-Are you serious?

442
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,870
They are one more.

443
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,714
You are the referee. So,
Günther, you go in goal,

444
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,513
-Stand compactly.
-Compactly.

445
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,355
(Datty) Don't sit down.
Put it between the chairs.

446
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,477
-(Fussel) Heads or tails?
-Tails.

447
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,199
I thought so. Okay.

448
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,114
Come on.

449
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,317
You must flip the coin.

450
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,514
What are you doing?

451
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,117
You said I should throw.

452
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,590
Okay, you sausage
heads can start.

453
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,832
-Come on, Rosi, come on, do it.
-I can't.

454
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,640
-If you don't like something, whistle.
-What?

455
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,394
-(Datty) The
whistle, -Blow into it,

456
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,190
I'm not stupid. I have a
doctorate in literary studies.

457
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,431
All the better. A
whistle, madam.

458
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,955
(soft whistle)

459
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,915
You do it. Günther,
you've got him.

460
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,159
(Lamprecht) Yes! That’s
one to nil by Lamprecht.

461
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,709
(he is overjoyed)

462
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,638
How awesome is that? Yes!

463
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,234
Hey, guys, where…

464
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,274
-Where are you guys going?
-That’s really too brutal.

465
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,080
That's really too
dangerous. But never mind.

466
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,912
Wait a moment.
Guys, wait a moment.

467
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,480
(Geese honk)

468
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,074
(louder whistle)

469
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,954
("Crazy Town" by Richard
Myhill, bouncy Ska rhythm)

470
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,913
(one doesn't understand him)

471
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,200
I want to be in the Bubble too!

472
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,756
(Music stops)

473
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,439
(Datty) Günther?

474
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,351
-(Fussel) Harsh, -Günther?

475
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,518
(Fussel) Everything okay?

476
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,073
(general groaning)

477
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,595
(Fussel) Was it good?

478
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,153
Come down, sweetie.

479
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,991
Yes, I am out of breath.

480
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,437
Oh, there’s the coin.

481
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,956
-Günther, I'm sorry about
that, -You were the one.

482
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,554
-Okay? Yes.

483
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,911
-Merle, is everything alright?
-Yes, I kind of have a...

484
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,878
Unsteady on your feet?

485
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,000
-That was fun.
-Now we're going to shower.

486
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,037
-You did a good job.
-Thank you.

487
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,518
-Oh, hi.
-Hey.

488
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,798
Don't you have a home?

489
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,753
Emergency service.

490
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,640
Ready for what?

491
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,629
They are far too
lazy, to cause trouble.

492
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,960
You clearly don't.

493
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,599
I am something special too,

494
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,952
Not as special as you think.

495
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,474
(he laughs)

496
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,189
What do you want to
be, when you grow up?

497
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,070
Please?

498
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,799
If you grow up, what
do you want to do?

499
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,433
(Fussel smacks his lips)

500
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,115
Good morning.

501
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,709
Good morning,
Mr. Poschka. You are late.

502
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,235
Well.

503
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,553
Also, yes, good. Let's
just start with you then.

504
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,519
You still owe us a performance.

505
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,990
Who you are, what
brings you to us…

506
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,390
All clear, so, let's go.

507
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,476
My name is Andreas
Poschka, friends call me Fussel,

508
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,395
I am here because I’m completely
burned out, like all of you,

509
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,439
And I live in a socially
problematic area.

510
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,194
and just take
care of the people,

511
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,432
I'm fully on board with
that, that's really my thing.

512
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,230
What kind of people
are you helping there?

513
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,552
Yes, there is for
example… Little Ali.

514
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,791
That might be a brand.

515
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,916
Refugee child, Afghan,
speaks no German.

516
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,152
and practically
always attracts trouble.

517
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,314
Go ahead and tell [me].

518
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,518
Yes… (he clears his throat)
Recently, for example,

519
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,598
There I see Ali standing on
the playground down below,

520
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,354
and then there are
also these three tree-tall,

521
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,275
really nasty, vile guys,
tattooed skinheads,

522
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,750
they’re standing
around him and shoving…

523
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,672
(Scene becomes silent)

524
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,672
(light music)

525
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,193
(silent scene)

526
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,400
Well, but all that sympathy,
that naturally takes its toll.

527
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,152
You are not burned out.

528
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,959
It comes in waves.

529
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,997
You're just here on
vacation, you parasite.

530
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,959
If the fortress here is
supposed to be a vacation…

531
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,079
I bet you haven’t worked a
single day paying income tax.

532
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,995
And later we can
continue to fatten you up.

533
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,800
-You are a burden to us
all, -Money, money, money.

534
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,429
That's all, you can think of?

535
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,797
You must really be
a very sad person.

536
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,272
Tell me, who actually
gives you the right to do that?

537
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,150
I don't have the strength,
to argue with you, Anatol,

538
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,749
-Do you have family?
-The whole world is my family,

539
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,430
No children?

540
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,679
-Yes, a daughter, -Really?

541
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,753
And how old is she?

542
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,911
(He clears his throat) Eight.

543
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,832
Eight. And what’s her name?

544
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,352
-Lina.
-Lina?

545
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,994
My middle one is also eight. Is
Lina coming to the open house?

546
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,270
-No.
-Why not?

547
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,354
Also, I…

548
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,354
I often have to think of my
children here in the clinic.

549
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,594
That I want to be with them very
quickly, because I miss them so much,

550
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,677
But that, you know…

551
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,115
That’s a good goal too,

552
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,673
that one feels better,

553
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,878
so that one can
quickly get back to them.

554
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,236
Mr. Poschka, there you are. I
was just about to speak to you.

555
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,353
Mr. Poschka!

556
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,919
(Fussel sighs)

557
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,433
Mrs. Linde? What
are you doing here?

558
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,279
(Merle) What did
you say, my darling?

559
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,874
What kind of woman?

560
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,920
Why is a woman
cooking lunch for you?

561
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,639
Has Dad the...

562
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,717
Wait a moment, could you
quickly pass me my dad?

563
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,109
Mhm.

564
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,791
(Dr. Gunst) He is
a liar, Mrs. Linde,

565
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,951
(Frau Linde) That's
not true. He is deeply...

566
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,033
(Dr. Gunst) He is one of those
people you believe anything from,

567
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,077
because one wants
to believe them.

568
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,596
Mr. Poschka is a seducer,

569
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,993
They’ll fire me if this
comes out and if that’s true.

570
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,074
-You can’t do that to her.
-I’m not doing anything to her.

571
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,158
If the welfare office cuts my
benefits, I will be homeless.

572
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,596
Not if you go to jail.

573
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,309
You made all of this up?

574
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,712
There isn’t an Ali at all?

575
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,313
I have observed over the past few days,
how the patients have been reacting to you.

576
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,312
You reach people.

577
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,792
We used to be here 19
doctors, therapists, nurses.

578
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,629
Now there are eleven of us,

579
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,160
Yes, and?

580
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,075
We simply no longer
have the time and capacity,

581
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,629
to do justice to all patients.

582
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,399
No, right?

583
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,874
(he laughs) No!

584
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,758
Yes, if you want to stay here.

585
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,595
If you want me to believe
your Münchhausen story,

586
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,354
then you need to
make yourself useful.

587
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,674
Yes, okay, then I’ll make
you the animator here.

588
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,673
No, I don’t need a
cheerful busybody.

589
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,276
I need someone, who
really helps this person,

590
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,195
who listens to them, engages
with them on an equal footing.

591
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,629
What is that supposed to be?
An undercover therapist or what?

592
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,399
That’s definitely not legal!

593
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,916
Legal, illegal, who gives
a damn. Wasn't it like that?

594
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,154
Listen, amusing tramps
is one thing, fine and good.

595
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,315
But they repair
it, I can't do that.

596
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,880
They don't want to
confide in anyone for me.

597
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,197
I'm doing everything wrong.

598
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,472
Pack your things. I am
very sorry, Mrs. Linde,

599
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,873
Okay, I'll do it, I'll do it,

600
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,511
Okay, I’ll do that.

601
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,279
Mrs. Linde?

602
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,079
Mrs. Linde!

603
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,309
That was a close call.

604
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,232
(piercing scream)

605
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,675
What happened?

606
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,911
She shoved the pen into her ear.

607
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,119
Call an ambulance quickly.
Mrs. Gröning, please stay calm.

608
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,193
-(Fussel) What happened?
-Please go to your room.

609
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,830
No, no, no, no. Don't
touch. Stay calm.

610
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,753
The hands go down. Very calm.

611
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,957
And help is coming right away,

612
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,479
All good, all good.

613
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,717
(thoughtful music)

614
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,514
May I?

615
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,029
Sorry, there was a
little ketchup on it.

616
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,675
(Datty) She’s a
total control freak.

617
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,835
And besides, she has four children,
man, house, station wagon in the carport.

618
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,911
With that, everything
has to be flawless.

619
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,438
And one day, that's when
the shit really hit the fan.

620
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,636
(Thunderclap)

621
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,269
(Child) Mom?

622
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,594
Merle?

623
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,599
(he sighs)

624
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,872
Also, what’s wrong?

625
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,398
I love you. Will you marry me?

626
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,994
What?

627
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,638
You do hear me, though.

628
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,349
It’s all falling apart.

629
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,233
Everything breaks.

630
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,070
(soft guitar music)

631
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,389
(Television) ...Afternoon
noted the DAX

632
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,279
after all, 0.9% firmer
at 10,012 points,

633
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,000
Their high score,
however, is 10,323 counters.

634
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,994
still far from the
desired 10,800 mark,

635
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,913
While in the Asian markets…

636
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,277
So, let's turn off the Dagobert
Duck television for once.

637
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,750
and don't always just
think about money,

638
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,469
That, in fact, makes
you stupid and unhappy.

639
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,599
Well.

640
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,996
Old man, let me
tell you a story.

641
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,755
My father was just like
you, He had a dowel factory,

642
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,511
Always just worked,

643
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,478
Always shit on it.

644
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,670
And then he died, at 52.

645
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,274
Stroke.

646
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,909
I tried to be sad.

647
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,829
I really tried, to miss him.

648
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,071
Tears are welling up in my eyes.

649
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,270
-You don’t believe me, do you?
-Nope,

650
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,193
Are you compulsively
lying, or are you just a loser?

651
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,192
Dude, we're all losers,

652
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,789
We all didn’t buckle
up in the carousel.

653
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,837
and flew out of the curve.

654
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,514
That’s why we’re here,

655
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,479
Only I never felt like
wearing a seatbelt.

656
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,349
And you think your bank
account protects you in some way,

657
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,638
But all this coal-shoveling
is fucking irrelevant...

658
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,996
You have absolutely no idea.

659
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,110
Okay, then tell me.

660
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,073
(ominous music swells slowly)

661
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,636
Please all come together, I
have an important announcement,

662
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,952
No matter what you're doing
right now, it can't be that important.

663
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,839
like that, what I
have to tell you now,

664
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,837
I was good with
numbers even as a child.

665
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,829
But you can’t
calculate everything.

666
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,278
Sometimes things
don’t go as planned.

667
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,314
And then one must be
able to react spontaneously,

668
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,279
otherwise, others
simply eat you up.

669
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:03,472
Mrs. Dr. Gunst says I have a
pronounced deficit of spontaneity.

670
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,359
and psychosocial inflexibility.

671
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,638
That is to say, you are a
smart aleck and a know-it-all.

672
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,112
No, that is to say, I have a
psychosocial flexibility deficiency.

673
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,949
Okay.

674
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,519
Jürgen, I’m sorry,

675
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,478
Do you know that
feeling, when you think,

676
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,314
You deserve, to be spat on?

677
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,557
15 people were laid off,

678
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,473
just because I made a mistake.

679
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,511
That’s like with a cell phone.

680
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,389
After a few years, the battery
always discharges faster and faster.

681
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,871
As soon as you charge it,
it’s immediately empty again.

682
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,874
Eventually, work is over.

683
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:59,679
(Subway trains rattle
and squeak ever louder)

684
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,760
Sell your company,
and your Porsche.

685
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,514
Hm?

686
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,557
I don't have a Porsche.

687
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,632
(strained groaning)

688
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,395
(Fussel) Man, you won't believe this.
Even the pee-wee aunt gets more done.

689
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,198
Not so easy, to get
your ass in gear, huh?

690
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,478
One more could still go.

691
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,313
"Text Ideas"?

692
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,151
Are you a fan of Texte Ideas?

693
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,998
(singing) "Slap power in
the face, victory to passion.

694
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,039
We will win! We will get you!"

695
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,158
-The first album.
-The best album.

696
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,272
I was with the
guitarist for six years.

697
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,033
Seriously?

698
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,160
What are the guys up to?
I was hoping for a revival.

699
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,391
Jonas now has a blog.

700
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,076
Thomas is now a
big shot in the SPD.

701
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,631
The loser has an online shop
for condoms and air fresheners.

702
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,633
-No! Yes

703
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,274
And Max?

704
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,832
Max... Max has
drunk himself to death.

705
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,552
Live fast, die young.

706
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,039
-I wanted to ask you something.
-(annoyed) What?

707
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,114
What actually happened
to Günther’s face?

708
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,277
I’m supposed to help him, right?

709
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,353
If you help him, then
as quickly as possible.

710
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,434
In ten days, his therapy ends,
unless a miracle happens by then,

711
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,796
does he then end up in
a closed psychiatric ward,

712
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,353
Wow. To the psych ward?

713
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,719
But that can’t be done.
He’ll go under there.

714
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,234
Yes.

715
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,317
Yes, and what am I
supposed to do now?

716
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,871
Just be yourself.

717
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,474
Only better.

718
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,471
(mischievous music)

719
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,749
What are you doing? Have
you never seen “Prison Break”?

720
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,399
"Papillae"?

721
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,671
"Escape from Alcatraz"?

722
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,070
-Didn't see any of it, man?
-Nah,

723
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,393
(Datty) Where do
you guys want to go?

724
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,713
-To have a little beer.
-Why don’t you let me know?

725
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,230
Yes, then come.

726
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,519
-Okay.
-Come.

727
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,793
-Psst! Yes

728
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,159
(atmospheric pop music)

729
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,271
(light, airy disco-funk)

730
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,513
Günni...

731
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,719
-Do your friends call you Günni?
-No,

732
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,791
You, I’m worried about you,

733
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,672
Hm? What’s wrong with
you? What happened?

734
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,073
Tell me.

735
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,917
You don’t want to expose
yourself like that, I understand.

736
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,151
We're all in the same boat.

737
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,233
We are all overwhelmed
and insecure, all of us,

738
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,238
You don't.

739
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,831
You know, when I became
a father, I was really in shock.

740
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,154
War… war absolutely not planned.

741
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,589
Nora, also Lina’s mother, and I…

742
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:45,873
We weren’t even properly together.
But it just happened anyway.

743
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,917
(Nora) What smells so bad here?

744
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,832
-Everything okay?
-Everything okay.

745
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,309
(Baby crying)

746
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,238
-Are you still quite
alright? „Fuck!

747
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,438
-Not at all, everything is okay!
-The pizza is ready.

748
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,071
(He coughs) I wanted
to make dinner,

749
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,231
You only build crap..,

750
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,439
And then is…

751
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,673
Nora came to life.

752
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,313
Car accident.

753
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,471
Lina then went to Nora’s mother.

754
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,597
I naturally wanted to
continue seeing my little one.

755
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:30,913
Andreas, she needs a father,
not stupid remarks and loud music,

756
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,278
-She had plenty of fun,
-And your horror stories!

757
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,431
Happy Birthday! (Shouts)

758
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,716
She’s into horror stories.

759
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,840
She probably got that from
me. So, more like spooky,

760
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,549
You weren’t at her
ballet performance,

761
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,313
She cried terribly,

762
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,359
And now you show up and
want to go camping with her,

763
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,876
-Yes, to make up for it.
-What? Until next time?

764
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,839
Dad! I packed a compass,

765
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,115
-Hey, little mouse,
-And cookies,

766
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,870
Lina, it won't work out
this time with the camping,

767
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:07,479
-Andreas has another appointment,
-But I packed everything up,

768
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,518
Of course we’re going camping,

769
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,469
I also have a few Chinese firecrackers with
me, then we’ll launch fireworks into the air,

770
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,837
Behave yourself like an adult,

771
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,436
Do you always have to interfere,
you narrow-minded witch?

772
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,990
What the hell is
all this bullshit?

773
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,437
Man, you always
make such a fuss, hey!

774
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,194
“Dad...
-That disgusts me, man!”

775
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,477
I don’t want to go
camping anymore,

776
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,997
-What? But why not?
-I want to stay with Grandma,

777
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,869
But Lina…

778
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,394
You are mean,

779
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,114
-Oh come on, Lina, -To
yell at Grandma like that,

780
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,679
Little mouse…

781
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,389
I won't let anyone take
my daughter away from me.

782
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,430
Lina is the best, that
has ever happened to me,

783
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,514
By a mile.

784
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,119
And what about me?

785
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,873
I only build crap.

786
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,830
Your grandma is right. I
would just mess up the little one.

787
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,277
-Hey, Fussel,
-Datty, stop it.

788
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,956
-I love you.
-Stop, you're annoying me now.

789
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,192
You're annoying. Stop
with the bullshit, man!

790
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,954
Man!

791
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,239
Sweetheart.

792
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,040
Sweetie…

793
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,914
Are you a faggot, or what?

794
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,553
(catchy pop Schlager music)

795
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,634
(Battle cry)

796
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,518
(Schlager music
continues to play)

797
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,479
(Roar)

798
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,836
Let me go, you wanker!

799
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,560
(Datty) These
filthy farmers. Idiots.

800
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,994
(as a doll) That comes from
the incest here. No, Fussel?

801
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,357
-You're getting on my nerves.
-You fought for me.

802
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,919
Yes, great!

803
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,278
I wanted to chat with
Günther in peace and quiet.

804
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,272
Not that kind of
psycho bullshit,

805
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,070
You freak! No wonder the
children are afraid of you.

806
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,074
What?

807
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,753
Shitty bed, hey.

808
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,594
Lint?

809
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,911
(he sighs) What is it?

810
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,633
It was a nice evening.

811
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,920
Mhm.

812
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,394
I…

813
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,193
I am...

814
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,672
Entrepreneur, you know?

815
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,431
I have tanning salons.

816
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,311
Eleven branches
throughout the north.

817
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,750
It's also been going
very well so far.

818
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,433
At least financially.

819
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,996
I was always on the road
between Flensburg and Glückstadt.

820
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,600
Lübeck, Mölln...
Idiots everywhere.

821
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,550
Eventually, my wife was
gone. I was never home, either.

822
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,110
And if so, always on the phone,
there was always something going on.

823
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,352
(fragments of conversation)

824
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,159
I’ve also had too much to drink.

825
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,756
And then snorted cocaine.

826
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,195
Come on, you
asshole! Get lost, man!

827
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,554
Then I forgot things,
messed them up.

828
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,638
And then, a few weeks ago…

829
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,195
was over.

830
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,391
God, please don't
let me down now,

831
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,834
(Tires screech)

832
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,550
(Horn)

833
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,030
I can’t remember
anything at all.

834
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,919
How I got there, got out.

835
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,879
And you know what?

836
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,319
I didn’t care either.

837
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,358
Suddenly it was clear to me,
that everything is meaningless.

838
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,116
Sunbeds, it's all pointless.

839
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:33,634
Do you only get skin cancer from
tanning and look like a leather handbag.

840
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,279
And for what?

841
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,719
Pointless.

842
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,079
Everything is pointless.

843
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:47,917
(Computer) Welcome to Sweet
Sun, Your tanning program is starting,

844
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:51,038
I have always
dreamed of traveling.

845
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,952
To the Arctic Circle, It must
be so beautiful up there.

846
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,951
But then, of course,
it was all too late.

847
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,351
Then I fell asleep.

848
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,950
Can't quite remember
anymore, but it felt…

849
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,229
It felt somehow right.

850
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,718
I believe, I probably
just wanted to vanish.

851
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,516
Therefore, I'm constantly
crying. My tear ducts are blocked.

852
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,876
(Fussel takes a deep breath)

853
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,439
Burnt.

854
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,713
Stay that way.

855
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,032
I am crying forever now.

856
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,194
Shit, I wish I had burned.

857
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,713
I still want that too.

858
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,152
Simply not to be there anymore.

859
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,836
(soft voices, joyful greetings)

860
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,159
Hey, Fussel,

861
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,074
Well, Datty.

862
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,194
Are you sulking?

863
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,240
I'm sorry, I was drunk.

864
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,632
You really annoyed me
with your terror puppet.

865
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,675
(thoughtful music)

866
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,120
(Datti’s doll speaks
unintelligibly)

867
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,433
(Nurse) His mother,

868
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,991
We picked her up from the
senior living facility today.

869
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,629
You have to imagine that.

870
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,313
He is over 50 years old,

871
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,552
and only his grey
mother worries about him.

872
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,030
Cool.

873
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:21,272
That guy is completely messed
up. I don't know what I should do.

874
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,309
(melancholy guitar sounds)

875
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,000
-Oh, hey.
-How could you do something like that?

876
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,549
What?

877
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,269
How could you abandon your
children? Explain that to me.

878
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,593
What are you talking about?

879
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,593
You did leave your daughter,
didn't you? How old was she then?

880
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,675
What is that supposed to mean?

881
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,558
My husband wants a divorce.

882
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,112
Oh shit, that’s really
messed up. I’m really sorry.

883
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,271
We have four children, Four,

884
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,477
He's not just leaving me,
he's leaving the children too.

885
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,077
Don't you men
love your children?

886
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,833
Of course, I love my daughter.

887
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,119
Why aren’t you with her?
Why doesn’t she visit you?

888
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,715
I mean, don't you care?

889
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:53,111
No, of course not. It's a
little more complicated,

890
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:57,478
Oh, it's complicated. What is
it? How often do you see her?

891
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,711
-Often enough.
-Yes, how often?

892
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,359
Yes -Tell me, how often?

893
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,880
I sometimes oversleep
appointments.

894
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,270
-What kind?
-Just any one, I guess.

895
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,591
-Birthday or what?
-Yeah, could be.

896
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,878
How can someone forget
their child's birthday?

897
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,797
Don't you have a heart?

898
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,756
Say, do you want
to interrogate me?

899
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,157
(she sobs) He
can’t do this to us.

900
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,799
Excuse me.

901
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,639
Okay, fine.

902
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,154
Fussel,

903
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,638
What I told you tonight,
I’m doing that now.

904
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,519
Yes, do that.

905
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,514
Yes, of course.

906
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,434
Do you really mean that?

907
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,240
Yes, do it. You have to do that.

908
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,193
Fuck.

909
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,910
(Knocking)

910
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,873
Merle, it...

911
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,631
I’m sorry about your husband.

912
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,480
Totally shit,

913
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,794
Yes.

914
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,630
You really are a super mom.

915
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,599
You have everything under
control. You know the rules.

916
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,116
You are everything,
what your children need.

917
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,477
You can't explain to a child
why his father just leaves.

918
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,473
(Datty) Help! Help! Fussel!

919
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,754
Help!

920
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,070
Lint!

921
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,516
-Thank God he was
too heavy, -Too heavy?

922
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:05,159
-Inform Dr. Gunst.
-Günther!

923
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,674
Lint,

924
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,269
Lint,

925
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:16,474
I just wanted to say goodbye to
you. You are my best friend, after all.

926
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:21,190
-And the only one.
-"Say goodbye"? What are you talking about?

927
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,112
What kind of shit
are you doing here?

928
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,791
I told you everything, didn’t I?

929
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:30,273
As we were talking last night.

930
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,075
I asked you, if I should do it,

931
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,550
and you said:
"You must do that."

932
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,992
I can’t take this anymore.

933
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,511
Do your shit alone.
Do your shit alone.

934
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,830
(fast-paced punk rock)

935
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,271
Good morning, Mrs. Pasternak.

936
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,551
-Where have you been?
-Away.

937
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:07,076
I was worried. I thought
something had happened to you.

938
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,231
-Accident, or… drugs.
-Drugs?

939
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,915
The caretaker had
to check on you.

940
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,390
He aired you out first.

941
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,799
Man.

942
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,233
Just to disappear…

943
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,631
I couldn’t sleep for worry.

944
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,959
Excuse me.

945
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,675
(melancholy music)

946
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,439
Linde is my name.

947
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,118
-Bergstedt.
-I know.

948
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,390
(distant children’s laughter)

949
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,834
We must help Fussel.

950
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:52,470
Günther.

951
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,390
-I’m worried about Fussel,
-What about Mr. Poschka?

952
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,551
I have his address,

953
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:03,077
Let me have that. Where
did you get that from?

954
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,431
You broke into the office.

955
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:17,670
Psst.

956
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,394
(mischievous music)

957
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,157
What's going on here?
Have you looked at the time?

958
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,074
-Fuzz, help.
-We're stealing the clinic bus. Active.

959
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,114
Come with.

960
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:45,557
You're all out of your minds, aren't
you? You guys are really... nurses!

961
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,711
(muffled gong)

962
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,156
-Datty!
-Okay, who’s driving?

963
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,960
Who of us takes the
weakest medications?

964
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:57,556
-Weren't you angry at Fussel?
-It's too exhausting for me.

965
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,229
Anatol?

966
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,639
Hey, Anatol. (Enters)

967
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,711
-(Anatol) Oh man.
-This way.

968
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,837
-Stop!
-Shh. Not so loud.

969
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,675
Merle, be reasonable.
You're not like that.

970
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,719
Yes, I am. Here. Come.

971
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,835
Come.

972
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,520
Also?

973
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:36,679
-(Günther) Amitriptyline.
-(Datty) 100?

974
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:40,151
-225 -That’s even worse than me,

975
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,630
A miracle that you can walk.

976
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,837
Um, trazodone.

977
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,151
That's not so
bad. You can drive.

978
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,516
And, wait a moment...
Moclobemide,

979
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,879
What? They're giving you that
and MAO inhibitors together?

980
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,157
Yes -(Datty) Passenger seat,

981
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,950
-What kind of pills are you taking?
-Me? I have no idea.

982
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:00,834
Small and red.

983
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,274
Far in the back. Better.

984
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,592
-Anatol.
-No, no, keep me out of this.

985
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,433
Anatol.

986
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,833
Only Maprotiline 50, I will be
discharged the day after tomorrow.

987
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,393
You must help us.

988
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,069
(Doll) Go on, take a
chance, you sausage.

989
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,755
Please.

990
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,069
(Sound of a kiss)

991
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,038
Ugh! Will you guys stop it!

992
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,913
I need to concentrate.

993
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,879
Merle.

994
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,435
(energetic punk music)

995
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,473
Come on. Yeah!

996
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,435
Shit.

997
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:01,196
(Woman angrily) Did you
even turn the machine off?

998
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,749
(Man) Can you help
me carry that up?

999
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,479
No, I have the baby.

1000
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:09,429
Can you do that alone,
can you manage it? Man!

1001
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,193
Sorry, it’s dripping here.

1002
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:13,873
No shit, Captain Obvious.

1003
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,794
The idiot tried to wash.

1004
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,633
Here, take this.

1005
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:23,511
The rags are back there. What
do you want with the towels?

1006
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:27,753
Those are the good ones from my
mother., Dude, come on. Get a cloth.

1007
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,478
Get going!

1008
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,799
(soft electric guitar sounds)

1009
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,316
(powerful rock music)

1010
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,233
Next exit!

1011
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,073
Thank you, Mrs. Linde,

1012
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,713
(a long cheer)

1013
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,470
(Horn)

1014
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,597
-Hey!
-Square!

1015
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,438
Yes, there it is. Here.

1016
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,358
-Here...
-Well? Well?

1017
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:49,273
Poschka, Poschka,
Moment. Be quiet.

1018
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,794
Poschka, Poschka...

1019
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,839
Fussel isn't the type
for a doorbell sign.

1020
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,354
-Poschka? Yes

1021
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,318
-Are you looking for Fussel? Yes

1022
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:03,078
He wanted to go to
his daughter, he said.

1023
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,679
(Doorbell)

1024
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,155
Yes, I have it.

1025
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:41,278
In case of emergency,
contact: Petra Bargkoppel.

1026
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,829
Swinehagener Street 6, Hamburg.

1027
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,671
-Papa!
-My dear!

1028
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,513
I missed you.

1029
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,193
I missed you.

1030
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,520
Is that your tent? Do
you want to camp here?

1031
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,830
Andreas, what
are you doing here?

1032
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:10,517
Listen, Petra, I…
I’ve thought a lot.

1033
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,078
I was even in therapy,

1034
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,438
I love my little big one.

1035
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:22,832
And there… is a
huge hole without her.

1036
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,473
A huge hole, here.

1037
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,354
It is my fault. I messed it up.

1038
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,914
I thought I could sweet-talk
my way through with her.

1039
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,072
and just have fun,
and you do the rest.

1040
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:37,833
That wasn’t good.

1041
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,477
I understood that, really.

1042
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:46,231
But now… I want to be
a real part of your life.

1043
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,952
I'm not building
any more shit, okay?

1044
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,077
You’re not building
any more bullshit?

1045
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,789
You just broke into my place.

1046
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:59,394
(Doorbell)

1047
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,273
We are camping here
tonight. Right under your eyes.

1048
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,116
I missed you too, Dad.

1049
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:11,832
Who is the first in the
tent? Attention, ready, go!

1050
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,239
Hi.

1051
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,869
-(Anatol) Yo.
-(Merle) Good morning.

1052
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,475
Good day.

1053
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,554
Andreas. Andreas.

1054
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,074
Andreas.

1055
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:50,838
I just want to spend time with
her. You don't have to worry.

1056
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,356
-Lina, come into the house, -No.

1057
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,593
-Lina.
-No.

1058
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,752
Lina, your father and I
have something to discuss.

1059
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,510
Now that’s enough! Get
out of my way. Please,

1060
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,077
What are you doing here?
What is this supposed to mean?

1061
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,789
Active.

1062
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,719
Who are they?

1063
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,792
These are my friends.

1064
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,358
These are my friends.

1065
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,433
-So, come on, Lina.
-(Doll) Ease up a bit.

1066
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,716
Who are you, actually?

1067
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,875
Favor. Dr. Günther Gunst.

1068
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:40,749
I am a psychotherapist at the
Soltron Clinic in Bad Mückensen.

1069
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,480
Mr. Poschka is undergoing
treatment with me,

1070
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:48,031
and we all here,
Dr. Anatol... Liliak,

1071
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,555
Sister Merle, Mrs.
Linde from physiotherapy.

1072
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:54,430
and Mr. Datrus…

1073
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:57,559
Mr. Datrus is a patient,
who needed some fresh air.

1074
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:01,509
We are here to see Mr. Poschka, who has
made enormous progress in the development

1075
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:04,911
made to his
personality, to support…

1076
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,639
That is absurd.

1077
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,399
You burst in here. You're
confusing the poor child.

1078
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:13,914
I am not confused.

1079
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:17,675
Excuse me, but Andreas
has done a lot for us.

1080
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,514
Lately, Mrs. Bargkoppel.

1081
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:22,433
(Anatol) Merle, what
are you doing there?

1082
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:28,756
Perhaps you could
still give him a chance,

1083
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,240
Mrs. Bargkoppel?

1084
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,554
Do you have children?

1085
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:39,234
-Yes, why?
-Would you entrust him with your child?

1086
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:43,276
Yes, all four.

1087
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,273
(Frau Linde) Me too.

1088
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,559
Mine is already out of the
house, but yes, I would do that.

1089
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,991
-(Merle) Anatol.
-What is it?

1090
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,316
-I don’t have any
children, “Now.

1091
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:02,638
He could also look
after my plants.

1092
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,154
Yes.

1093
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:07,915
Lint really means
a lot to all of us.

1094
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,559
Please, Grandma.

1095
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,919
Let me at least try, please.

1096
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,714
We are all careful,

1097
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:32,030
Thank you. For
everything and for…

1098
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,075
You know.

1099
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:39,389
-Bye, Grandma.
-Buckle up, Lina.

1100
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,038
(Puppe) Well, did you
butter up the old woman?

1101
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,599
Get lost.

1102
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:53,714
(calm rock music)

1103
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:01,118
(Dr. Gunst) Kitchen work,
cleaning, and you talk to the patients.

1104
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:05,513
But you can’t spend the rest of
your life working for room and board.

1105
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,711
Well, I’m still recovering
from my burnout.

1106
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,677
So? Already heard about it…

1107
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,231
-Well, Lina, are
you excited? Yes

1108
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,879
Camping with Dad.

1109
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,839
If I get out of here,
I’m going camping too.

1110
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,519
And trekking. Hiking.

1111
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,273
North Cape is
supposed to be great.

1112
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,000
For months on end,
the sun doesn't set.

1113
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,595
There are Northern Lights.

1114
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:02,037
There are then colors in
the sky. Yellow, red, blue.

1115
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,352
It must be crazy.
North Cape. I'm doing it.

1116
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,030
(Lina) Really?

1117
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:13,909
That's why it's called a low-pressure
area. It pushes everything down.

1118
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,071
The mosquitoes are
flying around down there,

1119
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:19,756
and the swallows want
something to eat and... Oops.

1120
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,879
-Papa, the tent is burning.
-Oh, fuck.

1121
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,112
Not so bad. It's just
a small hole. Shit!

1122
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,756
Whatever. Oh man!
What are we going to do?

1123
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,470
We're playing Fireball,
To the other side, go!

1124
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,594
Attention, and…

1125
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:42,990
(powerful rock song)

1126
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,639
The beautiful ball!

1127
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,078
Active!
