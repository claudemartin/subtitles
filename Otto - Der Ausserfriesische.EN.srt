here, and look out up there,
and

00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:00,915
then you can
pick-pick-pick-Pictures!

[Otto imitates chicken noises]

And kick off your feet,
when you come back out.

00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:17,707
But now you go
in first, everyone in.

177
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:21,623
And look out, admire how we Frisians have cleared away

178
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:24,582
the mountains to reveal this unique landscape underneath.

179
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:26,707
So flat, it's like a disk, you

180
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,916
know it, from the Beatles, Yesterdaich!

Not 2 Marks, not 4 Marks,
no, 6 Marks!

that they drive
to my

dream of mankind, the dream of jet propulsion.

I don't see any problems,

The area is totally flat,
almost deserted.

205
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,290
The land belongs to a
Baron von Platt,

who is broke,
he sells without any problems.

No problems?

Nothing to blow up,
nothing to concrete,

no one to bribe,
no one to corrupt?

Is there nothing out of the way
to clear? That's just awful!

Grödel,
what is that?

213
00:11:09,457 --> 00:11:11,707
A small lighthouse,

-Yes, but he's a small fish.
-Grödel?

218

Even small fish
can stink.

219

That is very true,
Mister Van Devil.

220

But we can only buy the rest
if we have this fish on the hook.

00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:55,457
Oh, Otto.

498
00:25:55,582 --> 00:25:58,582
-Oh Frauke, come on!
-But not in Benno's Tower.

499
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,207
Why Benno's Tower?

500
00:26:01,332 --> 00:26:04,082
Because it still belongs to
Benno, your older brother.

501
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:05,874
And because everything
reminds me of him.

502
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:09,582
His style, his taste,
his sense of beauty.

503
00:26:09,707 --> 00:26:11,623
And the whole well-kept atmosphere.

504
00:26:11,832 --> 00:26:15,040
I promise you, nothing will be left
of it," nothing will remind you of him.

505
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:18,541
I swear to you, I will
erase Benno from our lives.

[Deep breath.]

508
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:23,832
So, you think, that I'm someone like Benno,

509
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,957
would take advantage of the situation, and here, and there..

510
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,166
Otto please, not in
front of the children!

511
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:33,207
So you think I'm someone
who would do that, thank you.

512
00:26:33,582 --> 00:26:35,415
Please stop with the jokes.

513
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:37,291
So are you coming?

514
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:38,665
Yes.

-Yes.

That's Frauke's salad!

But you would be
quite good for the soup.

about buying right there.

00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:23,790
or you're out tonight.

we have here?

[Screaming]
Hey!

00:35:06,832 --> 00:35:10,540
-What's that?
-Wait, you don't hit a man with glasses.

676
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:12,165
You don't have
glasses on.

677
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:13,749
I'll get some quickly.

for me and my friends.

This has to be celebrated.

687
00:35:35,124 --> 00:35:36,582
So, may I congratulate you?

688
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,041

Baron?

689
00:35:38,124 --> 00:35:41,915
Much better, Herr Assessor, I am
selling the inheritance of my niece.

[Soft laughter]

Uncle, I want to know everything
about your shady dealings now.

693
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,374
That's none of your business, whether

694
00:35:52,457 --> 00:35:54,957
I sell to Highspeed or anyone else.

695
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:58,082
Highspeed, some
multinational corporation.

696
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:00,707
-A nasty company.
-Exactly.

697
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,416
And what they have planned for
our country doesn't interest you?

698
00:36:03,499 --> 00:36:05,374
Ah, the people
have money, that's enough.

699
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,249
They have money,
I can confirm that.

700
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,249
Who needs
this Highspeed nonsense anyway?

Let's ask the majority.

703
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,291
Imagine, 
 gracious lady, you get

704
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:18,374
in here at 8 o'clock

705
00:36:18,457 --> 00:36:21,165
you are 
 in Paris at 9 o'clock.

706
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:22,499
Paris?

707
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:24,915
What am I supposed to do 
 in Paris?

708
00:36:25,332 --> 00:36:27,123
What about my crabs then?

709
00:36:27,249 --> 00:36:30,874
They have to be eaten by
noon, they taste best when fresh.

710
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:33,498
Well then, get back in then, and

711
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,915
"zack" you are home again an hour later.

712
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:38,790
Home, that's nice.

713
00:36:39,124 --> 00:36:40,957
Where do I sign?

714
00:36:42,082 --> 00:36:44,582
You see, gentlemen? 
 That is the proof.

715
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:45,874
What is all this supposed to mean?

716
00:36:45,957 --> 00:36:48,707
Without Benno's
property, nothing runs here.

717
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,415
And you, you stay 
 on your land.

718
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:52,873
Wait and see, wait and see!

719
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:56,040
Your clean Benno skipped town
a year ago.

720
00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:58,915
He didn't care a whit
about his country.

721
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,749
What rights does he even have
left?

722
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:02,665
And what about
my customary right?

723
00:37:02,832 --> 00:37:06,082
I go there, I live there,
I heat there,

[sad music]

271 Marks
and 30 Pfennigs!

728
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:17,540
They're still open,
since Benno's farewell party.

729
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:22,999
Exactly... eleven endless months

730
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,416
[Sighing]
and three long weeks.

731
00:37:26,582 --> 00:37:28,373
Thank you Frieda, thank you.

732
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:31,915
Then this Benno has
precisely one week,

733
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,915
to reclaim his land.

734
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:37,082
And, as the
old Frisian law prescribes,

735
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:40,540
through planting a tree
by one's own hand.

736
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,957
I've never heard of that.
Where does it say that?

737
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:45,665
So it says, black on white,

738
00:37:45,874 --> 00:37:47,582
in the book of the Frisians.

739
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:49,874
[surprised sigh]
And further the

740
00:37:50,374 --> 00:37:52,165
book says: "If the homeland
is

741
00:37:52,249 --> 00:37:54,082
threatened, only one can help in times of need.

742
00:37:54,249 --> 00:37:57,374
A young man, noble,
pure and good,

with brown hair,
and great courage."

744
00:38:00,707 --> 00:38:02,123
Great, I'm
out of this one.

745
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:05,624
And there will never
be one like that here.

[Dirty laugh]

747

right now.

[Giggling]

749
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:13,666
He doesn't want to make out.

750
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,124
- Maybe he can't?
- Everyone can do that.

751
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:21,707
Not now, they're not
making out again today.

752
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,041
[Disappointed sigh]

753
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:26,457
After all, she was with him
yesterday.

754
00:38:26,582 --> 00:38:28,290
What did they do
then?

755
00:38:28,957 --> 00:38:30,623
Probably just chatted
again.

756
00:38:30,707 --> 00:38:32,540
What are they always chatting about?

757
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:35,582
As it happens, I can
read lips.

758
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:37,874
And therefore I can tell you

759
00:38:37,957 --> 00:38:39,415
that Frauke
demands Otto to

760
00:38:39,499 --> 00:38:41,457
save the homeland immediately.

761
00:38:41,582 --> 00:38:43,915
That's totally
uncool.

762
00:38:44,457 --> 00:38:46,207
Der da
shall save the homeland?

763
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:48,165
He can't even make out.

764
00:38:48,249 --> 00:38:49,624
If she kisses him, he will

765
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:51,998
certainly get an organism.

766
00:38:52,874 --> 00:38:55,249
Frauke, you don't believe
what people say

767
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:56,582
about us, that I am only marrying you because

768
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:59,166
you inherit a fortune from your uncle, do you?

769
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:01,457
I would marry you even if you

770
00:39:01,582 --> 00:39:03,873
inherited the fortune from someone else.

771
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:06,624
Besides, we
love each other platonically.

772
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,957
And if it's a boy, he shall
be named Plato, yes?

773
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:12,332
Otto please, it's about
our homeland, our future.

774
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:14,624
Future?

775
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:16,791
You know what is in
the book of the Frisians.

776
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:19,665
Benno must plant the tree
within at most four days.

777
00:39:19,832 --> 00:39:21,332
Then the land is ours.

778
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:23,624
Our country, our home,
our child.

779
00:39:23,957 --> 00:39:25,665
And we call
the child not Plato.

780
00:39:25,749 --> 00:39:27,499
We call it
after our grandfather.

781
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:28,873
Ah no,
then he would be called Grandpa.

782
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,124
Yes, but first Benno
has to plant the little tree.

783
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:32,540
You have to go.

[Sighing]

1626
01:29:18,291 --> 01:29:19,374
So?

[Children's laughter]

1628
01:29:41,999 --> 01:29:43,665
Our home,

1629
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:45,249
our country,

1630
01:29:45,374 --> 01:29:46,874
our future,

1631
01:29:47,124 --> 01:29:48,582
our children.

1632
01:29:49,166 --> 01:29:50,874
Kids? Let's get
started right away!

1633
01:29:50,957 --> 01:29:52,790
-Otto please!
-Yes?

1634
01:29:53,124 --> 01:29:54,957
One thing you have to
promise me from now on.

1635
01:29:55,041 --> 01:29:56,207
And what would that be?

1636
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:58,374
Please no more jokes.

1637
01:29:59,499 --> 01:30:00,832
I promise you that.

1638
01:30:01,249 --> 01:30:03,040
One more I have! A
man comes to the doctor,

1639
01:30:03,124 --> 01:30:05,915
says, every time I do
that it hurts awfully then,

1640
01:30:05,999 --> 01:30:07,499
says the doctor,
don't to that.

1641
01:30:07,582 --> 01:30:09,457
Then let's take a
look in our wallet,

1642
01:30:09,541 --> 01:30:11,041
there's a 500 Deutschmark
bill growing there.

1643
01:30:11,124 --> 01:30:12,540
He must be removed operatively.

1644
01:30:12,624 --> 01:30:14,874
Sister, tongs, Panties!

1645
01:30:14,957 --> 01:30:17,998
The doctor to the patient: 
"I can't find anything. 
It has to be the alcohol"

1646
01:30:18,082 --> 01:30:19,457
The patient: "Ok, then I come
back when you are sober."

1647
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:23,374
Two young men who are
attaching the exterior plaster,

1648
01:30:23,457 --> 01:30:25,332
and suddenly the
scaffolding collapses.

1649
01:30:25,416 --> 01:30:28,416
Both fall down, one is
smashed on the ground,

1650
01:30:28,499 --> 01:30:31,040
the other was lucky, he was
stuck with his eye on the nail.

1651
01:30:31,124 --> 01:30:33,665
Give me a cigarette, my
pack is still in the machine.

1652
01:30:33,832 --> 01:30:35,373
Please, please,

1653
01:30:35,457 --> 01:30:37,415
you are wrong! she cried,

1654
01:30:37,582 --> 01:30:41,540
Her eyes were filled with fear. 
Please, please don't!

1655
01:30:41,624 --> 01:30:44,540
But it was too late, he had
already put on the Heino record.

1656
01:30:44,666 --> 01:30:48,082
Aunt, I shot my arrow into
your garden, can I get it back?

1657
01:30:48,249 --> 01:30:51,124
But gladly, where is
he then? In your cat!

1658
01:30:51,416 --> 01:30:55,832
I'm constantly on the go, constantly
stressed, never at home, and everywhere

1659
01:30:55,916 --> 01:30:58,416
and privately there's nothing going
on anymore, when I'm at airports

1660
01:30:58,499 --> 01:31:01,665
if I wasn't constantly searched for weapons,
I would have no sex life anymore.

1661
01:31:01,832 --> 01:31:05,415
Mrs. Krueger, for 6 years
you have lived by the highway,

1662
01:31:05,499 --> 01:31:07,582
is there any	subsequent damage?

1663
01:31:07,666 --> 01:31:10,832
Noooo! Nooooo! Noooo! Noooo!

1664
01:31:11,166 --> 01:31:13,666
Now don't clap
that bad air in here.

1665
01:31:13,749 --> 01:31:17,290
At the drive-in theater recently
two best friends froze to death.

1666
01:31:17,374 --> 01:31:19,790
They wanted to see the film "Closed for the Winter".

1667
01:31:19,957 --> 01:31:24,373
Every Thursday, all members
of the Otto Fan Club meet

1668
01:31:24,457 --> 01:31:25,748
in the phone booth.

1669
01:31:25,832 --> 01:31:30,165
My aunt said my birth would be a
contribution to environmental pollution.

1670
01:31:30,332 --> 01:31:34,373
She caught me then, when
the doctor let me fall laughing.

1671
01:31:34,541 --> 01:31:37,582
I had big ears, I stayed
inside during rabbit hunts.

1672
01:31:37,707 --> 01:31:41,582
Liver to brain, where's the
alcohol, I have nothing to do here!

1673
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:44,332
Holladihitti, Holladihitti!

1674
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:47,123
Hello, Echo! Hello, Otto!

1675
01:31:47,249 --> 01:31:50,749
-You, Susi?
-Hey, who's that?

1676
01:31:50,957 --> 01:31:53,123
I, your hairdryer.

1677
01:31:53,291 --> 01:31:57,791
-You, Dad?
-Yeah, my child?

1678
01:31:57,957 --> 01:31:59,915
-What are you doing all day?
-Driving a tractor!

1679
01:31:59,999 --> 01:32:03,165
Okay, okay, okay,
I've got one more!

1680
01:32:03,374 --> 01:32:05,915
Hey, you're not
paying attention at all!

1681
01:32:06,041 --> 01:32:07,374
Of course I'll watch out!

1682
01:32:07,457 --> 01:32:09,207
-No, you are not watching over it!
-Yes, I am watching over it!

1683
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:11,374
-How many children do you have?
-Six! -See, you can't keep up with them!

1684
01:32:11,457 --> 01:32:13,832
Hello, Mister Vegetable.

1685
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:15,249
Good day, Mr. Kohl.

1686
01:32:15,332 --> 01:32:17,373
-Do you understand me?
-I understand you very well.

1687
01:32:17,499 --> 01:32:18,999
No, you cannot understand me.

1688
01:32:19,082 --> 01:32:22,665
-Yes, very good even.
-No, no one can understand me.

1689
01:32:22,791 --> 01:32:27,291
Cheers... Cheers...

1690
01:32:34,082 --> 01:32:36,082
Fascinating, how I have
the masses in my hand.
