1
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:07,256
(Bird chirping)

2
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:12,257
(Music box sounds, waltz music)

3
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:33,490
(Waltz melody is
taken over by piano)

4
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,289
Be a good boy and eat.

5
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,502
You don't want to make me sad.

6
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,630
- And hold yourself straight.
- Yes, Mom.

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,051
You can also eat here
tonight. There's enough food.

8
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:57,139
- Do you like the turkey breast?
 - Wonderful, Mom. Wonderful.

9
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,979
If you want to sleep here,

10
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:06,940
your children's room
is always ready for you.

11
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,530
I'll heat up the
purée for you again.

12
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,501
I'm late.

13
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:28,545
First we eat!

14
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,052
Paul?

15
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:36,762
Yes, Mom?

16
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,682
Why did you just
take this apartment?

17
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:42,517
Other boys live at home too.

18
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:44,728
Yes, Mom.

19
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:54,696
- Pussi?
 - Yes?

20
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:56,865
Did you bring me your shirts?

21
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:59,910
Oh no, Mom, this
really doesn't have to be.

22
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:03,330
My dear child, I have been
washing your shirts for 50 years,

23
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,541
so that you look presentable.

24
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,253
- Get your hair cut.
- Yes, Mom.

25
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,546
Customers look at such things.

26
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,633
You are now the boss
of Winkelmann and Son.

27
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,053
Like your father
and grandfather.

28
00:02:17,386 --> 00:02:20,055
I'm proud of you. You
don't eat anything at all.

29
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,141
I can't anymore.

30
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:41,743
Excuse me. Do you know
how I can get to Schinkelstraße?

31
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:43,787
Yes. Schinkel Street...

32
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:45,831
This is Schinkel Street.

33
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:47,290
Yes.

34
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,882
(Subtle glockenspiel)

35
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,385
Grid blind is actually
no sheer curtain.

36
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:43,555
Then just a sheer curtain.

37
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,850
Are the... patterns
from England here yet?

38
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:49,102
- England?
 - Uh, Italy, I mean.

39
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:53,399
- Oh no. They are just...
- I can also get you something...

40
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:57,193
Those people over there
are looking for a wardrobe.

41
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,364
- Also, if you want more...
 - Can I help you in any way...?

42
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,533
We are looking for
a bedroom wardrobe.

43
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:04,618
For suits, where you also...

44
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,704
With a rail and clothes pegs.

45
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,206
- A-and shoes.
- I know what you are looking for.

46
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,042
Where is the brochure for
the Danish comedy series?

47
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,336
There in the dresser.

48
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:22,802
The advantage of the
Danish combined series

49
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:26,014
is based on their
space-saving dimensions

50
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,143
and their well-thought-out
interior design.

51
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:33,564
I should actually be able to
show you the Trulleberg model.

52
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,859
Yes, Trulleberg. That's
Trulleberg.

53
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:39,069
Very solidly built.

54
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:42,405
- I just wanted to ask...
- I'll be right with you.

55
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:45,617
What did I have, uhm...? Oh yes.

56
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:48,953
Another advantage is
the possibility of self-assembly.

57
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:53,041
- If we first ourselves...
- That's no problem at all.

58
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,295
You lift the deck
plate from the pins.

59
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,381
and let the side
panels swing out. See?

60
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,091
And together again?

61
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:02,759
Re-clip side panels.

62
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,553
and secure it
with the cotter pin.

63
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:07,138
Miss, uh,
Hagebusch, where is the bolt?

64
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,935
- for Trulleberg?
- ...35% polyester blend.

65
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,063
Would you hold this for a moment?
It's quite easy with two people.

66
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,068
Perhaps if the gracious
lady here...and if you...?

67
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,112
You just need to lightly
support the deck plate.

68
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:27,200
- I have a...
- One second, madam.

69
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,870
Where is that bloody
bolt for the Trulleberg?

70
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,790
- In the box. But if you…
- Which box?

71
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,959
Next to the rotting
cotton ripstop.

72
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,920
- A little more precise, please.
- Dresser, middle drawer.

73
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,046
Or something light in cream.

74
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,049
The Danish comedy series

75
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,968
is incidentally available
in almost all colors.

76
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:48,179
Also in eggshell.

77
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,724
Eggshell fits in everywhere.

78
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,852
How are you otherwise set up?

79
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,374
- Yes, please? 
 - I would like slips.

80
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,043
- Size 5?
 - Um, 6.

81
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:24,758
That is pure cotton with
a 60% polyester blend.

82
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,594
The model is emphasized in the buttocks
area, so it's a bit tighter in the...

83
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,889
Or do you prefer it a little tighter
in the buttocks and therefore...

84
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,392
- No, no.
- I'll quickly take a look in the warehouse.

85
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:35,101
- Size 5? 
 - 6.

86
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:37,604
Here at least you're
served friendly.

87
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,148
I did not serve you rudely.

88
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,276
- Hey, I beg you!
- Rude service?

89
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,860
No, we were just talking...

90
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,445
I was perhaps a bit inattentive.

91
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,948
Inattentive, if I go
down to the cellar?

92
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,660
- You are not meant.
 - I had only said...

93
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,787
You misunderstood.

94
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,914
You will be well
looked after here.

95
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,540
My customers are satisfied.

96
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,293
- If my service...
- I spoke to the lady.

97
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,505
Do you have short-sleeved
house jackets with a braid pattern?

98
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:06,800
(Absolute silence)

99
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,302
Is anything wrong?

100
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,015
What was it anyway? What
could I have possibly...?

101
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:16,726
I would like to have the seating
group upholstered in my practice.

102
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,520
A seating group.

103
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,689
And another thing I
wanted to ask about.

104
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,774
But if you are so overloaded...

105
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,736
Perhaps we can sort this
out now over a cup of tea...?

106
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,654
No, that doesn't
work well today.

107
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,074
Oh no, I also have
a club meeting.

108
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,118
And what if I were to stop by
tomorrow with my sample books?

109
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,079
Alright then. I'll
give you my card.

110
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:40,584
Come on, where did I put
them again? Maybe around 11?

111
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,045
Well then...

112
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,515
- Mr. Winkelmann.
 - Excuse me, please.

113
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,829
Psychologist?

114
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,543
Diplom... Psychologist with diploma.

115
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,434
Men are the most primitive, vilest
and stupidest thing that...

116
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:41,603
Mrs. Mengelberg, you
raised a point there.

117
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,190
- Would you like to elaborate on that?
 - Elaborate!

118
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,860
In our open-plan office work
2 ladies and 11 gentlemen.

119
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:52,030
Every time I from
the customer registry

120
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:55,658
To go to the purchasing department, I
have to go through accounting.

121
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:59,412
And then Mr. Wegner from...
touches me from behind.

122
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:02,916
- That's the most primitive...
 - We understand you.

123
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,460
I don't even know what to say.

124
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,296
We want to deal
with the incident...

125
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,590
You get stupid
answers as a woman!

126
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:12,467
- It's best to say nothing.
 - So, Mrs. Mengelberg,

127
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:15,845
it is hard for you, after
the described impertinence

128
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,724
to express that
opposite Mr. Wegner,

129
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:23,020
- what you are feeling.
- That is the most primitive...

130
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:27,231
Let's play out the
incident here in the group,

131
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:29,609
and you say quite fearlessly,

132
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,780
what you would have always liked
to get rid of towards Mr. Wegner.

133
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:36,699
Mr. Dr. Giesebrecht,
would you play Mr. Wegner?

134
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,287
You have therefore just touched
Mrs. Mengelberg from behind.

135
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,831
- What?!
- So, Mrs. Mengelberg.

136
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,875
What would you like
to tell Mr. Wegner?

137
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:51,673
Yes... um... so...

138
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,635
That you don't do that again.

139
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,930
I have never touched
Mrs. Mengelberg!

140
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,767
Mr. Dr. Giesebrecht,
You are now Mr. Wegner

141
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,394
and gave Mrs. Mengelberg a slap.

142
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,521
Ah, I see...

143
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,024
Well, she doesn't
want it any other way.

144
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,401
Mr. Dr. Giesebrecht, You
are indeed the most primitive...

145
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:14,320
Mr. Wegner! Mrs. Mengelberg,
You are speaking with Mr. Wegner,

146
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:17,198
not with Mr. Dr. Giesebrecht.

147
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:21,035
You're going to get one right
in the rear, Mrs. Mengelberg.

148
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:23,746
- Dr. Giesebrecht!
 - Right behind you!

149
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,457
- Mrs. Mengelberg!
- On the rear!

150
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:27,750
Mr. Dr. Giesebrecht...

151
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,295
- You are the stupidest...
 - Mrs. Mengelberg!

152
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:32,839
- on the rear!
- Mrs. Mengelberg!

153
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,467
- Women should always...
- Always on the rear!

154
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:49,022
Oh, excuse me!

155
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:51,232
Good evening, Mr. Winkelmann.

156
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,945
(Incomprehensible, muttering)

157
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:01,493
Ah, Mr. Dr. Schmitt! Good
evening, Mr. Winkelmann.

158
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,374
May I take your order?

159
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,333
- 1 beer.
- So how much beer?

160
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:11,002
- 1 Pils.
- 2 Beers.

161
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,921
- 1 Cola.
- 1 Rosehip tea.

162
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,965
- 1 normal tea. 
- With milk or lemon?

163
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,508
Milk.

164
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,885
Excuse me. For
me a quarter dry red.

165
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,804
1 dry red.

166
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:22,889
- And 1 "Schlemmer" slice.
 - 1 "Schlemmer".

167
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,808
Mr. Winkelmann, you are
chairing today's meeting.

168
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,185
Oh what? Yes, um, ah I see.

169
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,105
Yes, then I realize
that we are all present.

170
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:32,315
The gentlemen politicians
and Ms. Westphal.

171
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:34,192
That I could already…

172
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:36,694
Yes, you should hold on to that.

173
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:39,447
Uhm, in our last club meetings

174
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,826
do we have club
matters and club goals?

175
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,287
outlined by our association,

176
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,708
but we have not yet been
able to agree on a club name,

177
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,503
which clearly expresses
our club's content.

178
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,839
I believe Mr. Kempe had...?

179
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,760
Yes. Our association wants to, yes,
the terms woman and environment.

180
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:02,553
to bring into carnival thoughts.

181
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,515
I mean, this goal.

182
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,436
should be clearly
included in the club name

183
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:12,397
- 2 beers, 3 tea, 1 Schlemmer?
- And a quarter of red wine.

184
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:14,106
1 Cola.

185
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,276
2 beers, 1 cola, 1 wine,
1 Schlemmer, 3 tea.

186
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,028
-2 Tea.
- 1 Rosehip, 1 regular.

187
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:20,905
- 2 beers, 3 cola...
- 1 cola.

188
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,159
1 Cola, 2 Beer, 1 Wine
1 Schlemmer, 1 Rosehips,

189
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,078
- 1 normal.
- 1 Pils.

190
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,081
- 1 small.
- 1 pilsner, 2 beers, 1 small.

191
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:32,250
Only 2.2 in total.

192
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,337
Sir, uh, Kempe, you
were just about to...

193
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,089
Yes, I would have a question
regarding the order of the terms,

194
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,509
the integration of the
terms into the sequence...

195
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,636
Please remember what
you want to say, Mr. Kempe.

196
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,554
We should assume that

197
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:46,681
that the carnival idea
takes precedence,

198
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,017
because Yes the terms
woman and environment

199
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,144
to incorporate
into Carnival ideas.

200
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,854
Mr. Dr. Schnoor.

201
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,817
The term "woman" offers, after all,
Scope for carnival and environment!

202
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,944
Mr. Müller!

203
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,529
Also "Society for Carnival
despite woman and environment”.

204
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,448
- Not at all!   - Ah, I see.

205
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,533
- I'll record this first. 
- No, no.

206
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:07,952
"Carnival in Remembrance
of Woman and Environment"?

207
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:10,330
Also, I have to...

208
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,791
The terms
woman, environment and carnival

209
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,293
- are 3 very hot irons.
- Mr. Mueller.

210
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,921
- Very hot irons.
- Mr. Müller.

211
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,215
- Mrs. Westphal wants... -
Well, here we are going to...

212
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,925
Very hot irons!

213
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:25,094
The woman surely has older
rights than the environment!

214
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,098
That must be clearly
stated in the club's name!

215
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,018
Mr. Winkelmann! What have I
been fighting for all these years?!

216
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,105
- Then formulate it once!
 - Good God!

217
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,941
I would say: "Association
for the Integration of Terms"

218
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,986
Carnival and environment into the
woman.". That also sticks with one.

219
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,948
- And where is the thought?
- Which thought?

220
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,326
- Very right.
- The term carnival

221
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:50,036
includes the idea of
the concept of Carnival.

222
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,956
Should I perhaps already
jot this down so far?

223
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,250
We shouldn't decide
anything today yet.

224
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,961
What's in the minutes so far?

225
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,381
"All club members were present."

226
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:03,424
(Rhythmic clapping)

227
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,428
And again right away,
because it was so beautiful.

228
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,681
5, 6, 7, 8!

229
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,058
(More rhythmic clapping)

230
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,020
Thank you! Well, that was
already Housewives' Special Class!

231
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,899
What a good mood we're in today!

232
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,652
Mr. Romanowski!

233
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,656
Would it be agreeable
to Dr. if we began?

234
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:29,909
The woman Dr. is going to
get very uncomfortable soon.

235
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,622
- Then you'll get a little something on the rear! 
 - Not on the rear!

236
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,267
(Upbeat Music)

237
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,961
(Sentimental Music)

238
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:42,023
(Music turns dramatic)

239
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,454
(Music now very moving)

240
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,836
(Abrupt finale)

241
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:24,523
Winkelmann?

242
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:26,567
- Mom, are you asleep yet?
- Yes.

243
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,653
- Ah, I see.
- What is it?

244
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:31,239
- I just wanted...
- Sleep tight, my Pussi.

245
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,824
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

246
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:39,622
<i>So. That's now
1.8 m at 32.50 DM.</i>

247
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:41,999
250 m at 1.80.

248
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,003
Uh...Mark, uh...meter.

249
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,089
- 250 m?

250
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:52,093
No. That's not correct.
Uhm...let me see.

251
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,221
- Miss, no...er...
- Hagebusch.

252
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,016
Where are the price lists
for Australian cotton bodies?

253
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:00,017
I'm a little overwhelmed
at the moment.

254
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,854
You've been in my business for
11 years and you don't know that?

255
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:05,940
Please take care of this, Sir,
I have an appointment.

256
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:08,609
As you wish, Mr.,
uh, Winkelmann.

257
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,084
(The doorbell rings)

258
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:29,046
- Well, you're right on time.
- Yes.

259
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,175
You don't live far from
Merkel. Dieter Merkel.

260
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,303
We'd best go to the
practice right away.

261
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,973
That would be the
seating area here.

262
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:41,058
Seating group?

263
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,062
Excuse me, Mrs. Tietze,

264
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,482
a seating group is an
upholstered furniture set,

265
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,193
consisting of a
sofa and armchairs.

266
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,572
You have 5 chairs
here with padded seats.

267
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,615
Ah?

268
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,742
What connections
did you have in mind?

269
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:00,411
I was very satisfied
with the old ones.

270
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,456
That is a very,
very poor quality.

271
00:18:03,873 --> 00:18:05,624
I mean, I can of
course order that,

272
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,710
but you won't enjoy that.

273
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,796
Then why don't you
make a suggestion?

274
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,133
We will tailor everything
to your wishes.

275
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,680
Do you actually know that
you bear a great responsibility,

276
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,390
- if you recommend a color?
- Pardon?

277
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:25,019
A single woman, who
tends towards depression,

278
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,231
would kill herself in a
purple seating group perhaps.

279
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,359
Even if it's flowered, the
seating group?

280
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:33,319
I also advise couples,

281
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,864
they have certain
interpersonal difficulties.

282
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:40,739
And I am sure that one
often through new materials and colors

283
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:44,079
that living together could be
made much more harmonious.

284
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,958
Oh, Mrs. Cookies, Mrs.,
uh, Mrs. Tietze,

285
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,585
Do you have a few
cookies in the house?

286
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:52,505
- Cookies?
- It's not that important.

287
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,465
I want to advise a couple
tomorrow on this point.

288
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,635
The company Winkelmann
has been for 63 years...

289
00:18:58,094 --> 00:18:59,386
I would like this consultation.

290
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,931
not simply left to a
decorating company.

291
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,268
I want to proceed according to
modern psychological insights.

292
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,063
I'm just missing the
expertise in the textile industry.

293
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,859
This fall black is
very much in demand.

294
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:16,987
Why don't you just leave
me your sample books?

295
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:20,241
The company Winkelmann
is making you an offer.

296
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,451
We visit the customers together,

297
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,537
You conduct the negotiations,

298
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:27,540
we deliver the reference
material and you get 10%.

299
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,668
You have already
misunderstood me again.

300
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,298
- I could call you.
 - No, I'll call you.

301
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,425
Oh, excuse me.

302
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:40,010
Oh, Mom, this doesn't
suit me at all right now.

303
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:42,179
And when would it suit you?

304
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:46,100
If I don't run right now,
I'll be late everywhere.

305
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,480
Was that one of your crazies?

306
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,108
My crazies aren't any
crazier than you and I.

307
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,828
Mr. Bröseke asked me what
you are actually doing.

308
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,081
I never know then what to say.

309
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,418
Psychologist! God in heaven!

310
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:15,880
- Your father would have...
 - Yes, I know, my father

311
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:18,090
was a higher-ranking
civil servant.

312
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,677
Dad! You have trash cans too.

313
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:24,680
- Everything's all mixed up!
- He just does what he wants.

314
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:27,725
- Here come the Schröders.
- Of all things!

315
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,729
- Good day, Mrs. Tietze. 
 - Good day, Mrs. Schröder.

316
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:35,190
- Good day, Mrs. Tietze.
- My mother, the Schröders.

317
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,443
- Good day. 
 - Everything mixed up.

318
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,570
My father, Mr. and
Mrs. Schröder.

319
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:42,573
Bones, plastic, food
waste, Bottles, paper...

320
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:44,825
My father at the time

321
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,911
the municipal waste
disposal is organized.

322
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,788
As managing director.

323
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,791
- Have a nice day then.
 - Goodbye.

324
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,043
- Goodbye.   - Goodbye.

325
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:56,629
Very nice people.

326
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,257
That's all pure wool, sir.

327
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:01,884
- And what about this?
- That's striped.

328
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,595
Ah, that's striped?

329
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:08,599
No, if we start only after
dinner, it will be too late.

330
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,768
Hello, Mrs. Winkelmann.

331
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,313
- What is all this lying around here!
 - I'll write it down for you.

332
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:18,276
- Paul?   - Right away, Mom.

333
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,655
He looks a little pale.

334
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,782
He should get more fresh air.

335
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:26,659
He's gotten a bit
fuller because of that.

336
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:29,662
3.5 m English
scouring wool at 182,

337
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:32,665
That makes a total of 637 DM.

338
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:35,000
Pussi, how much
do you weigh now?

339
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,586
Thank you. My wife
will then call you.

340
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:40,172
Mom! I had begged you
so much, if I may serve...

341
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:42,299
- Yes, yes. 
 - We just want to remind you.

342
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,385
I know, today is
our game night.

343
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:45,886
Do you remember?

344
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:48,722
- You have something
there. - And don't call me Pussi.

345
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,687
H...E...

346
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:57,523
"He". 2 points.

347
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,068
- It's not that much, anyway.
 - It's enough for me.

348
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:03,487
Mechthild, it's your turn.

349
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,991
Wait. Wait!

350
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,510
"Dog nose". What is
that supposed to be?

351
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,846
What is that supposed to be?

352
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,931
That's not a word.

353
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,017
Dog's nose is a word after all.

354
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,603
<i>Dog's nose, Aunt Mechthild.
It's called Dog'S nose.</i>

355
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:39,273
- I told you so. 
 - The "E" is missing.

356
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,276
Dog's nose is spelled with "s".

357
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:43,319
I only have one "E".

358
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,655
Then you just can't put it down.

359
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,115
But it is a common word.

360
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:52,161
- You're putting something else down now.
- "Dog nose"! Never heard of it!

361
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:56,582
You're welcome. You're welcome.

362
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,886
(Inaudible)

363
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,437
"Taildog".

364
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,982
Yes. That's 57 points.

365
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,442
Explain to us, what
a "taildog" is.

366
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:28,318
- What needs explaining?
- I don't know the word, actually.

367
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,826
A taildog is
a dog with a tail.

368
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,120
Ugh, come on, Mechthild!

369
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,123
- Every dog has a tail.
- Please observe the rules.

370
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,584
- We don't say tailpig. 
- She always uses such words.

371
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:44,546
- There are dogs without tails.
- Not in my house.

372
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:48,550
- Mom is right.
 - Your vocabulary is too small.

373
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:51,345
- Also, Mechthild!
- Yes, yes, yes.

374
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,849
Then I could have put my
jellyfish dumplings down too.

375
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,810
If you don't stick to
the rules of the game,

376
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,896
- It's no fun.
 - Am I in school here?

377
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,484
Call me when the ladies
have reached an agreement.

378
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,445
- Paul?
- Yes?

379
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:10,823
- Are you going to your room?
- Yes, Mom.

380
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:13,993
- What does he have then?
- Oh, he has nothing.

381
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,292
That's Paul's cucumber!

382
00:24:30,718 --> 00:24:33,929
(Piano music - it sounds as if
someone were practicing piano)

383
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,738
(Bear growls)

384
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:51,864
(Bear growls)

385
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,411
Have you been waiting long?

386
00:24:57,745 --> 00:24:59,496
I like to be outdoors.

387
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,959
Then let's go. So, so that we
don't misunderstand each other.

388
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,128
What matters most is that
this couple lives happier.

389
00:25:06,587 --> 00:25:08,338
I know.

390
00:25:14,762 --> 00:25:18,348
<i>You have a lovely
garden, Mrs. Metzer.</i>

391
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:20,893
Yes, it does a lot of work.

392
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:24,855
Flowers... a bouquet of flowers
can change an entire room.

393
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,276
- We have more vegetables. 
 - Vegetables...

394
00:25:28,776 --> 00:25:30,986
Vegetables have
something so fresh.

395
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:33,030
Excuse me?

396
00:25:33,322 --> 00:25:36,491
And a fresh coat of paint
is like a new beginning.

397
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,454
We wanted to try, after all,

398
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,415
through other colors
in the living area, uh...

399
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,543
to get other problems
under control.

400
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:49,338
When did you have this
sofa reupholstered last?

401
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:54,381
Yes, well...it should
be about 23 years.

402
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,472
- Exactly 19.
 - That would be an option!

403
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,891
A fresh yellow,
an apple green...

404
00:26:01,225 --> 00:26:04,436
We were actually
very satisfied with gray.

405
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:06,897
<i>- Mrs. Metzer...
- Satisfied!</i>

406
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:09,691
I have a gray collection here
from a Belgian company...

407
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,403
- Mr. Winkelmann! 
 - I know already.

408
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,447
There you have 28 shades
of gray in every quality.

409
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,576
You will be satisfied.
Mouse gray, dust gray,

410
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:20,452
- Ash gray.
- Mr. Winkelmann!

411
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:23,497
Steel gray, lead
gray, cement gray...

412
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:27,292
Mr. and Mrs. Melzer want
something fresh! Yellow or green...

413
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:30,879
Yes, but with that the
gentlemen were not satisfied.

414
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,966
I'll put this here for you,
so you can see it better.

415
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,222
Excuse me, I would have liked
to speak with Mr. Winkelmann

416
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:42,933
I'd like to withdraw briefly.
Would you please accompany me?

417
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:50,107
You didn't understand
what it's about!

418
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,236
Yes, Ms. Melzer was
very satisfied with grey!

419
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:55,153
From a psychological
point of view

420
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:57,197
Melzer's are mistaken!

421
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,910
Now we're going back
inside and you just listen!

422
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:03,912
- But when Melzer's...
- Just listen.

423
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,958
Mr. Winkelmann still has beautiful
tones in yellow and matt green,

424
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,671
which has a very positive effect
on the atmosphere in this room

425
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:16,713
and thus also affect
your well-being.

426
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:19,261
We would like the ash grey.

427
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,308
Should I recommend a
really fresh stone gray there?

428
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,478
No! We had talked about
the effect of colors, hadn't we?

429
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,648
Yes. You said that if Mr. Melzer
was in a purple seating group

430
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,943
he would kill his wife.
- What?!

431
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,654
Only not if it's blossomed.

432
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,199
- Waiter? 
- One moment.

433
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,785
It was nice, working with you.

434
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,330
How you explained all
of this to the Melzers,

435
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,791
psychically, I mean.

436
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,919
- And I mean...
- Evenin', Mr. Winkelmann.

437
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,505
Good evening,
Dr. Schnoor. And I mean,

438
00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:57,466
that interior
design, my industry,

439
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,677
much more scientific...

440
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,264
Thank you. I actually
just want something small.

441
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,768
Unfortunately I have to go
into the meeting right now.

442
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,478
I am secretary today.

443
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,522
But if you were still
there afterwards?

444
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,399
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Kempe.

445
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,526
We'd have brains today.
It's not on the menu.

446
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,195
- A mixed salad.
- Good evening.

447
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,322
Good evening, ma'am, uh...

448
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,825
If you were still
around afterward,

449
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,077
I would like to talk
with you sometimes…

450
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,704
Now I'm going to
eat a salad first.

451
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:28,705
Well then...

452
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,045
I consider it necessary
for reasons of efficiency,

453
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,255
to clearly identify us as
members of the association.

454
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,341
Why mark it then?

455
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,884
Let Mr. Meier-Grabenhorst
finish speaking.

456
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,844
Should I write that down?

457
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:45,347
I'll tell you then, Mr.
Winkelmann. Please.

458
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:48,142
I request that we, through
attaching an emblem.

459
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:50,560
to express our common
goal more clearly.

460
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,564
- An emblem after all!
- What did you expect?

461
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,067
I sat down with some advertising
professionals there once,

462
00:28:57,568 --> 00:29:01,238
the already leading politicians
who have successfully advised.

463
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:05,951
And we've come up
with something there.

464
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:08,870
- Perhaps I could...
 - Yes, please.

465
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:21,925
Well...

466
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,720
It is not intrusive
and yet memorable.

467
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,265
Above party lines,
but not apolitical.

468
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,101
I like, that with
losing this..., this...

469
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,771
- Nose.
- Uh, thanks. That's why

470
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:37,107
the unmasking of our
society can be symbolized.

471
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:39,109
- Mr. Dr. Schnoor...
- Moment.

472
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:42,613
As a concern of the
democratic social order.

473
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,242
I remember the order, that
we have as Germans

474
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:48,243
regarding our history.

475
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,580
Very good. But we should
also record that from Mr. Müller.

476
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,083
- Also, Mr. Winkelmann.
- Yes? How was that?

477
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,086
Subject matter and the
whole story, the entire story...

478
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,797
- with the social order?
 - After the overthrow

479
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:02,841
the predominance of man and
the inclusion of the woman...

480
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,053
Regarding the German
people as an indivisible nation...

481
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:09,097
And the inclusion of
women in the...

482
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,975
...when activating the
wetlands simultaneously

483
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:13,810
and the inclusion of
women in the societal...

484
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:15,979
construction process.
 - Not so fast.

485
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,900
Replacement of the man with
simultaneous activation of the woman,

486
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:23,653
including wetlands

487
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,366
into the German people
as an indivisible nation.

488
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,077
(Toilet flush rumbles)

489
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:34,290
(Sounds of voices chattering)

490
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,043
Something like this wouldn't
have been allowed here before.

491
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,673
Do you actually know,

492
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:47,135
How do you look?
Look in a mirror.

493
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:50,514
Good evening. Ah, there you are!

494
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:52,766
I was just about to leave.

495
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,851
Good evening, Mr. Winkelmann.

496
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,937
- Good evening. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

497
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,532
I'm not in any other club.

498
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:11,159
But through this
common  political work

499
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:13,745
one gets a glimpse
 for the big picture.

500
00:31:14,121 --> 00:31:16,039
Are you particularly
close to a party?

501
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,126
No, but I admire
politicians in general

502
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:21,294
this intellectual and
human superiority.

503
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,921
Good night, Mr. Winkelmann.

504
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,715
- Good night.
- Good night.

505
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:29,470
- Well then, um...
- Oh, I wanted to, um, too bad...

506
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,930
I would have
addressed the issues...

507
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,687
I would also find it very kind if
I could invite you for a cup...

508
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,737
I would like it if I could
invite you for a cup of tea...?

509
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:49,072
Thank you, but that looks bad.

510
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,200
I'm baking a
braided yeast bread!

511
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,744
The next 2 weeks
there's nothing to be done.

512
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,163
Then tomorrow.  I'm baking a
braided yeast bread tomorrow.

513
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,957
and we'll have a
cup of tea. At 5.

514
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,211
Karl-Ernst-von-Halmackenreuter-Str.
3, 2nd floor.

515
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,505
1 cup of tea and 1
braided yeast bread.

516
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,465
I'll try it.

517
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,735
Oh, excuse me, please.

518
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,154
I thought I had this time...

519
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:36,203
You naturally have problem hair,

520
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,206
But it can handle a new color
once in a while. Something fresh!

521
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:43,543
I am very satisfied
with my color.

522
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,546
If you take something away
here, it falls quite differently.

523
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:47,756
You can do such great things.

524
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:08,652
With a new hairstyle you
feel completely different.

525
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,239
Look here, Mrs. Tietze, I've been
wearing my hair like this for 8 days now,

526
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,450
I feel like a new person.

527
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:29,965
So! And that's not
something everyone has!

528
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,843
If you say so.

529
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,363
- Ciao.
- Goodbye.

530
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,145
(The doorbell rings)

531
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,237
(The bell rings again)

532
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,200
- Mrs. Tietze? 
- Yes.

533
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:41,995
You didn't expect
me anymore, did you?

534
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,748
Yes, I had only...
May I offer you the...

535
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:47,333
Thank you. I brought
you something.

536
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,587
- That's very kind of you, that...
- It's nothing, really.

537
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:52,839
That wouldn't have
been necessary.

538
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:55,842
Please, sit down
in the living room.

539
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,023
You have it nicely here.

540
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:13,068
Yes, it's enough for me.
I am usually with my...

541
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:16,446
That's really walnut veneer.
You can have those too

542
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:19,407
in oak, mahogany
and birch, flamed.

543
00:35:19,825 --> 00:35:22,536
The cupboard is for self-assembly.

544
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,331
Upon request with table and 2
chairs. That makes a total of...

545
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,543
Oh, how stupid! I have
the prices only on the list.

546
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,129
- Doesn't matter.
- Typical. When you need it.

547
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,300
Is that your mother?

548
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,468
Yes. That's Mom, my mother.

549
00:35:38,802 --> 00:35:41,513
A really, really famous
person. Really famous.

550
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:46,226
And this here is a sit-and-sleep
combo furniture piece.

551
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:51,606
Very decent in color.
5 two in white padding.

552
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:53,858
Please? Ah, yes.

553
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,737
It smells so good here. Is
that the braided bread?

554
00:35:57,154 --> 00:36:00,490
Oh yes. Please have a seat.

555
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,492
- And where are you going?
- To the kitchen.

556
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:05,954
- Do you like to cook?
 - Well, so-so. Mom cooks better.

557
00:36:08,874 --> 00:36:11,835
If you would be so kind
as to wait a moment?

558
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,966
At the upholstered furniture

559
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,053
I could make concessions.

560
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:31,062
It looks wonderful! Did
you bake it yourself?

561
00:36:31,438 --> 00:36:33,690
Yes. According to a
recipe from my mother.

562
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,777
- Would you like a sherry? 
- Just a small one.

563
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:42,491
(Romantic music)

564
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:50,081
Our cooperation has
been very good for me.

565
00:36:50,457 --> 00:36:52,208
Well, cooperation...

566
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,461
Are you very attached
to your mother?

567
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,255
Yes, indeed. Everyone
is fond of their mother!

568
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,508
Yes, yes, of course.

569
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,682
Ah, with you one can
really talk about anything.

570
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,437
Just do it.

571
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,939
Then I have to tell
you something now,

572
00:37:14,314 --> 00:37:17,150
What I have only said
once in my life to a woman.

573
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:20,653
I would like to
be in a barrel with you

574
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,281
ride over Niagara Falls!

575
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,617
That's all I've said
so far to my mother.

576
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:29,579
Then you should rather
travel with your mother.

577
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,208
Do you know... it doesn't
have to be in the barrel.

578
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,669
But if your mother has already
been looking forward to it so much.

579
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,964
We could just... why
shouldn't one simply...?

580
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,468
- Three in this dumpster? 
 - No, no pleasure trip.

581
00:37:42,968 --> 00:37:47,468
I have to go to Milan
for business soon.

582
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:50,934
And if you just came along now?

583
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,145
Business, you mean?

584
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,689
I'm not even thinking about it!

585
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:58,316
One could still add another day.

586
00:37:58,692 --> 00:38:00,777
Mr. Winkelmann, I have a job!

587
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:03,822
But not on the
weekend. Mrs. Tietze!

588
00:38:06,074 --> 00:38:08,284
Do you know,
Mechthild, I always say,

589
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,371
The young people
have their own lives.

590
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,499
He is the
youngest Well, no longer.

591
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:16,793
Paul has always brought me joy.

592
00:38:17,085 --> 00:38:18,669
He just needs to get out a bit.

593
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:21,631
He always goes to these
fabric clowns in Italy.

594
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,717
And then he constantly had
these representatives in the house.

595
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:27,887
This morning he wanted the
recipe for my braided yeast bread.

596
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,098
Ah, that's why I
wanted to call him again!

597
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:31,599
Does it have to be?

598
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,311
Is there a telephone
here, my child?

599
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:37,397
- At the buffet.
- Well, then I'll pay first.

600
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:44,237
Do I have to press
anything here, or something?

601
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:47,949
(Still romantic music)

602
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,210
(Clears throat)

603
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,756
How are you actually
called by your mother?

604
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:05,091
Mom calls me Pussi.

605
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,385
Pussi...

606
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:10,888
Do you know what I
have to think about?

607
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,642
If you tell me?

608
00:39:14,017 --> 00:39:16,686
To Mr. Bröseke, the
hairdresser for ladies.

609
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:18,896
(Phone rings)

610
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:22,067
- Excuse me, please.
- Please.

611
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,239
Winkelmann?

612
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,200
Pussi? You, I'm sitting
here right now with Mechthild.

613
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,620
and I just thought of something
else for your braided yeast bread.

614
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,872
(Inaudible)

615
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:39,417
Before you put it
in, brush it with egg yolk.

616
00:39:39,918 --> 00:39:41,377
Yes, Mom, yes?

617
00:39:41,628 --> 00:39:43,921
- I have to go now. 
 - Wait.

618
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,550
You could also sprinkle
it with chopped almonds.

619
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,886
Mom, we've almost
finished the braid.

620
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:53,681
- Are the gentlemen still here?
- Just out the door.

621
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:56,851
Hello?

622
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,771
Did the gentlemen
like the braided yeast bread?

623
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,358
Yes. That means, yesterday it
was less on a representative level.

624
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,111
I would like customer
service in the future more

625
00:40:06,486 --> 00:40:08,738
from a scientific standpoint...

626
00:40:09,114 --> 00:40:12,283
Mrs. Tietze, Dr. Tietze
is a psychologist.

627
00:40:12,784 --> 00:40:15,411
Oh, you didn't have
any visitors yesterday?

628
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:17,622
Yes, I'm saying yes.

629
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:19,582
Who?

630
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,627
Dr. Tietze.

631
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:25,338
How did you explain to the
gentlemen who Mrs. Tietze is?

632
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,799
There weren't any
gentlemen there at all.

633
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,303
That's when I called you,
while you were with this person...

634
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:34,472
Mom, Dr. Tietze is a scientist.

635
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,475
We work together.

636
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,810
Yes, that's what you
want to tell your mother.

637
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,478
Mom!

638
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,440
And what now?

639
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:47,068
I intend, to consult
with clients regarding

640
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,112
also the customer
service advising on...

641
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:52,032
to be advised by Dr. Tietze

642
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,160
So we can't shop alone anymore?

643
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,330
I unfortunately have to
go again next week to...

644
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,707
Ah? The lady must
surely come along then?

645
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,169
Maybe we'll have a few
more nice days, huh?

646
00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:07,380
- Mom!
- I want to tell you something.

647
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:10,550
Then she can also
iron your shirts.

648
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,221
(Upbeat Music)

649
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,974
(Sings) His sister's name is...

650
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,227
Shit!

651
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,271
- No, that's not her name.
 - I always forget her name.

652
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,481
Academics are surely overrated.

653
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,068
I feel sick, when
I think about it,

654
00:41:28,443 --> 00:41:30,194
what I have gotten myself into.

655
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:32,739
It's not for television.

656
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,908
You are standing
on a small stage.

657
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,869
at a company party in
front of 250 employees

658
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:41,748
of a medium-sized
plastic processing... thing...

659
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,041
-...operations.
- Yes.

660
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,086
- Clear?
- Clear.

661
00:41:46,461 --> 00:41:49,672
- Can I use the phone?
- Yes, of course.

662
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:52,300
And Chorus Line again.

663
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,846
(More music)

664
00:42:08,775 --> 00:42:10,735
(Phone rings)

665
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,032
(Music in the background)

666
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,410
Hello?

667
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:23,581
- Hello?
- Winkelmann.

668
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,750
Here is Margarethe Tietze.

669
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:27,794
I wanted to thank
you for yesterday.

670
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,963
And for the braided yeast bread.

671
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,048
Did you like him then?

672
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:35,051
A thousand thanks. Please?

673
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,222
It's so loud here. What?

674
00:42:41,516 --> 00:42:45,686
How could I go
to Italy with you?

675
00:42:51,401 --> 00:42:54,070
Then we fly together
over the Alps, land in Italy,

676
00:42:54,529 --> 00:42:57,073
The state carriage is
ready, I believe I am dreaming.

677
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,242
Do we have far to go?

678
00:42:59,576 --> 00:43:02,287
No, in 20 minutes we'll
be in Casapulchino.

679
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,581
This is Signor Mancinit,

680
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,333
- My Italian agent.
- Good morning, Signora.

681
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,669
Ben arrivati. Prego!
Come with me.

682
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:13,756
I have gotten a very
nice rental car for you.

683
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,134
<i>Mr. Mancini.</i>

684
00:43:17,844 --> 00:43:20,471
Mr. Mancini. Mr. Mancini?

685
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,059
Would you like to sit
at the front, Signora?

686
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:26,311
Oh no, rather in the back.

687
00:43:28,021 --> 00:43:30,231
Mr. Mancini, what about
these household goods?

688
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:33,484
We're coming by my
brother's place.

689
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,404
There we'll hold on for a
moment.  I'll bring him the things.

690
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:39,449
That's absolutely
no problem at all.

691
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,247
(Waltz music)

692
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:09,437
Northern Italy is preferably
used for agriculture.

693
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,690
Ah.

694
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:22,658
(Honking)

695
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,246
(Chicken clucking, dog barking)

696
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,000
Tonella!

697
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,880
Antonella!

698
00:44:38,925 --> 00:44:40,509
Un momento.

699
00:44:40,802 --> 00:44:44,180
You really see more, when
you drive down the side streets.

700
00:44:44,764 --> 00:44:46,474
(Speaking Italian)

701
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,026
Do you speak a foreign language?

702
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:57,568
English.

703
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,530
With English, you can
get through anywhere.

704
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:05,531
(Still speaking Italian)

705
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,963
Buon giorno.

706
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,508
(Bottles clinking)

707
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:31,686
(Bottles clink loudly)

708
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,606
Afterwards I'll eat a huge
portion of Spaghetti Carbonara.

709
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,816
(Bottles clink and clatter)

710
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:40,319
And afterwards
this warm egg foam.

711
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:44,156
Um, um... <i>Zabaione.</i>

712
00:45:57,545 --> 00:46:00,256
You'd better not
come into the company.

713
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,926
This is a nice cafe.

714
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:06,178
Have an espresso. I'll
take care of business.

715
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,181
and then pick you up here.

716
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:09,849
Don't worry about me.

717
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,769
- Well, then… see you later.
 - Signora.

718
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,855
(Bottles clink)

719
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,289
(Italian)

720
00:46:33,623 --> 00:46:34,665
Caffè, Cappuccino?

721
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:38,210
Alora, Cappuccino.

722
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:45,130
(Italian)

723
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,669
Prego.

724
00:47:32,265 --> 00:47:34,016
(Door bursts open)

725
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:38,480
(Everyone is talking in
Italian at the same time)

726
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,387
(Italian)

727
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:23,270
(Still loud, lively Italian)

728
00:48:24,442 --> 00:48:26,235
Signora!

729
00:48:32,283 --> 00:48:35,452
The new collections
have nothing fresh at all!

730
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,623
No apple green for
example. No apple green.

731
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,626
(Translated into Italian)

732
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:49,008
These are the colors
of this year's season.

733
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:51,469
Violet is not harmless.

734
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:55,056
(Italian)

735
00:48:55,598 --> 00:48:56,890
Why?

736
00:48:57,183 --> 00:48:59,852
Women gather in
purple seating groups.

737
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:02,563
(Translating)

738
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,149
Single women.

739
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:10,025
(Italian)

740
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,286
In Turin a soccer player
shot himself on his sofa.

741
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,622
but it was yellow.

742
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:23,626
What color, uh, sofa color
do most people survive in?

743
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:28,547
(Translating)

744
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,811
Mrs. Tietze!

745
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,987
That went faster,
than I thought.

746
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:53,155
I think so too.

747
00:49:56,784 --> 00:49:58,994
(Winkelmann) You seem
to be doing quite well here.

748
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,331
(Tietze) An older gentleman
bought me a shot of schnapps.

749
00:50:01,664 --> 00:50:03,582
And then you had to,
as thanks, perform tricks.

750
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,002
<i>They all balanced eggs there.</i>

751
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,505
Mom and I have been
driving to Italy for 12 years.

752
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:13,676
No Italian has ever
balanced an egg on a spoon.

753
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:23,477
Thunderbolt, Mr. Winkelmann!
You're not living badly!

754
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:29,233
Wait! Mrs. Tietze!
Our hotel is...

755
00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:31,610
...insane!

756
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:35,114
(Waltz music)

757
00:50:48,294 --> 00:50:51,422
(Music swells)

758
00:51:06,187 --> 00:51:07,980
(Italian)

759
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,066
There's always a lot
going on at weekends.

760
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:13,319
- What can I do for you?
- I would like...

761
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,571
(Italian)

762
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:18,365
I would like 2 single
rooms until tomorrow.

763
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,660
Have you reserved?

764
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:23,663
Ah, no. It...had just
turned out that way.

765
00:51:24,163 --> 00:51:25,706
With a bath or shower?

766
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,501
- I mean, it's probably enough...
- Oh yes, with a bathroom.

767
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:31,170
Yes, with bathroom.
One with a shower.

768
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:34,298
What price range would
you have... I mean, um...

769
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:37,760
With bath 320,000,
with shower 250,000.

770
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:42,556
That's then 490 and 380 marks.

771
00:51:43,224 --> 00:51:45,309
Oh yes, God Yes, why not?

772
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,396
Or would you have anything
else... or is that with full board?

773
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:52,441
We are almost fully booked
and the prices are understood.

774
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,777
- Without breakfast. - Sure.

775
00:51:55,069 --> 00:51:58,197
Okay. If you're already on
the road, you might as well...

776
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:01,158
- Your passports, please.
 - Your passport, please.

777
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,912
Would you like a
reservation for the ristorante?

778
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,832
Whether we want to
eat here in the restaurant.

779
00:52:08,207 --> 00:52:10,542
Let's eat over
there  at the pizzeria.

780
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,253
Or would you
rather like it here...?

781
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,381
Oh yes. Let's just stay here.

782
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,174
Here. Yes.

783
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:20,469
Then please 2 places
for this evening in, uh...

784
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:22,721
- Restaurant. - As you wish.

785
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,766
Your rooms will be ready soon.

786
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,851
Perhaps you'd
like another drink.

787
00:52:27,226 --> 00:52:30,145
Your luggage will be taken
to your room immediately.

788
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:33,274
We should order another drink.

789
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,568
until the rooms are ready.

790
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,571
Then I would like a
milkshake with apricots.

791
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,823
I'll take care of it.

792
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:44,576
My name is Winkelmann.

793
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:48,039
I would like a milkshake
with apricots and a...

794
00:52:51,876 --> 00:52:54,545
I may now escort
you to your room.

795
00:52:55,004 --> 00:52:57,297
Yes. Thank you very much.

796
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,688
Prego, Signore.

797
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:15,774
Ah, I would have liked to
see how you are accommodated.

798
00:53:16,275 --> 00:53:19,111
- Perhaps you would like to ...
 - Let's just have a look first.

799
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:26,785
How lovely.

800
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,958
(Bird chirping
penetrates from outside)

801
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,044
Also, you already
have a very safe taste.

802
00:53:35,461 --> 00:53:38,630
I thought to myself, if one's
already here, one should...

803
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,342
don't count pennies.

804
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,387
And the luggage
is already here too.

805
00:53:44,887 --> 00:53:46,847
That is pure cotton.

806
00:53:47,181 --> 00:53:49,433
With a mixture of a
maximum of 10%.

807
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,520
And this is the KB 30
with freezer compartment.

808
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:57,066
I have that one at home.
Only this one is in mahogany.

809
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:00,403
There's also a 550-liter model.

810
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,655
With a slightly higher
power consumption.

811
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:06,117
I could get that for you
with a 20% discount.

812
00:54:06,617 --> 00:54:09,911
I think, you aren't
listening to me at all.

813
00:54:10,496 --> 00:54:13,624
Yes. You want to
get me something.

814
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:17,295
I could get you the
KB 50 with 20% off.

815
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:20,047
Oh yes, of course.
That's very kind.

816
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,174
No, that's quite natural.

817
00:54:22,508 --> 00:54:25,219
I only understood
it acoustically.

818
00:54:25,678 --> 00:54:28,389
It doesn't matter. It
wasn't important anyway.

819
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,100
Yes, yes.

820
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:34,145
Well then, I'll just
take a look in my room.

821
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,856
I still have to unpack.

822
00:54:37,231 --> 00:54:39,733
- I'm calling you.
- Or I'll call you.

823
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,944
I could also drop by.

824
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:44,196
But then call me beforehand.

825
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:46,281
Then we'll go down together.

826
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,367
- Yes.
- If that suits you.

827
00:54:48,701 --> 00:54:52,037
Yes, but I'll call
you when I'm done.

828
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,708
Yes, good. Good.

829
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:11,473
(Makes trumpet
noises with his mouth)

830
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,572
(Bottles clink loudly)

831
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:42,087
(Honking and traffic noise penetrates
from the street into the room)

832
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:14,119
Waiter!

833
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:19,124
- I'll take care of it.
- Prego, Signore.

834
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:22,127
We would like a large
portion Spaghetti Carbonara.

835
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:25,673
- And Tagliatelle Funghi. 
 - We have French Week.

836
00:56:26,173 --> 00:56:28,550
- Everything on the menu. 
 - They have a French week!

837
00:56:31,637 --> 00:56:36,137
Can you tell me what a
"Poitrine de Beau Voyage" is?

838
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:41,271
- Not really. Waiter?
- Please?

839
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,233
What is a "Poitrine
de Beau Voyage"?

840
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:48,070
That is a  "Suprême Chevreuil
a la Soubri Gratinat".

841
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,657
Ah yes. That is a "Suprême
Chevreuil a la Soubri" baked.

842
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,326
- That's it, right? 
 - Yes.

843
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,413
And a "Mousse Rabelais
à la Lézanne"?

844
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:00,541
That is a "Queue d'Écrevissage
en Sauce Poupoule Courouse".

845
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,794
- Pu...what?
 - Poupoule Courouse.

846
00:57:04,253 --> 00:57:05,504
What is that?

847
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,049
Wait.

848
00:57:18,392 --> 00:57:20,185
This is a "Timbalette Volatile"

849
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,563
aux Fins Herbes
avec Pomerolles Dauphinoisettes

850
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,732
du Creme à la Louis Quatorze."

851
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,318
Then let's just take that.

852
00:57:27,693 --> 00:57:30,404
Twice the Visage de,
the Queue de Visage with the sauce...

853
00:57:30,863 --> 00:57:32,489
Poupoule Courouse.

854
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,790
Do you often travel abroad?

855
00:57:42,124 --> 00:57:44,626
Yes, Mom and I travel a lot.

856
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,296
I have in my practice
various gentlemen,

857
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,632
who also get along
well with their mother.

858
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,759
- With my mother?   - No.

859
00:57:52,134 --> 00:57:55,720
In the mother-son
relationship, the son refers to...

860
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:59,349
I mean, the mother is in her 
reference to her son on the....

861
00:57:59,892 --> 00:58:01,768
... referencing the son.

862
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,896
- Waiter? 
- You said that beautifully.

863
00:58:04,188 --> 00:58:06,398
The mother is indeed
the lap, the center...

864
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,443
Waiter, in the
refrigerator in our room

865
00:58:09,902 --> 00:58:12,154
there are always
only half bottles.

866
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,990
I will tell the floor service.

867
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,201
Germans!

868
00:58:17,576 --> 00:58:20,245
Only half bottles
are allowed in KB 30.

869
00:58:20,746 --> 00:58:22,956
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry. Winkelmann.

870
00:58:23,332 --> 00:58:25,542
- What is it?
 - Winkelmann.

871
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,799
I would like to tell you... I
actually never talk about it,

872
00:58:32,299 --> 00:58:35,927
but I have a completely different
relationship with my mother.

873
00:58:36,512 --> 00:58:38,764
I believe she never
particularly loved me and…

874
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,933
Please remember
what you wanted to say.

875
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:45,354
But the KB 50 is for whole
bottles, lying down and standing up.

876
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,649
That was not clear
to me as a child.

877
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:51,193
I could send you brochures.

878
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,362
- Excuse me. 
- It's alright.

879
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,447
La Queue d'Ecrevissage
Poupoule Courouse.

880
00:58:55,781 --> 00:58:57,199
Thank you very much.

881
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,201
Oh, thank you very much.

882
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,831
That, uh, looks quite sparsely plated.

883
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,304
I have met many people,

884
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:21,473
but besides Mom and Aunt
Mechthild no one calls me Paul.

885
00:59:21,932 --> 00:59:23,475
(Loud Squeaking)

886
00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:25,977
(Giggles)

887
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:28,980
(Giggles too)

888
00:59:29,273 --> 00:59:33,068
(Shrill screeching and laughter)

889
00:59:35,362 --> 00:59:39,449
Also, no woman, no other
woman has told Paul about me.

890
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,745
Paul also has
something very intimate.

891
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:47,166
(Still giggling and shrieking)

892
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:50,585
(Loud scream)

893
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,133
(Still whinnying)

894
00:59:56,383 --> 00:59:57,926
(Both) Well...

895
00:59:59,845 --> 01:00:03,890
And if I were now to ask you
to tell Paul to come to me?

896
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:07,645
Only if you then also
said Margarethe to me.

897
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,938
- Well then...
- Good night.

898
01:00:10,272 --> 01:00:11,606
Good night.

899
01:00:11,857 --> 01:00:14,192
(Still screeching and giggling)

900
01:00:31,752 --> 01:00:34,045
(Still giggling)

901
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,817
Cuckoo!

902
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,364
Cuckoo!

903
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:44,533
Oh, excuse me, please!

904
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:48,620
- By mistagke I...
- Zito!

905
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,416
(Italian)

906
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:00,257
My name is Winkelmann.

907
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:01,675
(Italian)

908
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:08,140
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

909
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,398
I wouldn't know at all
how I would behave there.

910
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,568
- They were armed. -
You have to stop people

911
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,738
by appearing confident,
throw them off balance.

912
01:02:23,155 --> 01:02:26,324
They immediately realize
that you are superior to them.

913
01:02:26,825 --> 01:02:28,618
But 20 against one?

914
01:02:28,994 --> 01:02:30,704
I just have to be careful,

915
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,666
that I don't let myself
be drawn into violence.

916
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,420
Do you actually mistake
yourself frequently for the door?

917
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,924
Or perhaps you'd rather
not find the right door at all?

918
01:02:42,424 --> 01:02:44,134
Excuse me?

919
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:47,930
If you want to find your way
through the opening of the other.

920
01:02:48,472 --> 01:02:51,641
from its own center into
the center of the other,

921
01:02:52,142 --> 01:02:56,312
for the realization of
the Self, the holistic Self,

922
01:02:57,022 --> 01:03:00,859
on the path of self-discovery
through the door to You,

923
01:03:01,485 --> 01:03:04,237
also from one's own self
to the you of the other...

924
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:09,197
to the other You come or find,
 uh, want to find,

925
01:03:11,036 --> 01:03:13,121
that's the door then,

926
01:03:13,497 --> 01:03:17,709
the open door, the
right way to open a door.

927
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:22,255
I know what you mean. One
leaf hangs next to the other,

928
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,384
as you and I, so
small and green.

929
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:28,261
One falls from
the tree like a fish.

930
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:31,181
Or like a bird, that
knocks on our door.

931
01:03:31,598 --> 01:03:33,600
Wonderful is all of this.

932
01:03:35,477 --> 01:03:36,769
Paul?

933
01:03:37,062 --> 01:03:38,813
Yes, Mama-Margarethe?

934
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,525
I would have liked to
have you in the picture.

935
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,276
Wait. Hello?

936
01:03:43,527 --> 01:03:46,029
Scusi. Fotografia la signorae me.

937
01:04:06,842 --> 01:04:09,302
Signor...perfavore.

938
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,687
(Shot, pigeons scatter)

939
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:25,819
Are no machines
flying today at all?

940
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,905
- Yes, but not in Italy.
- That's what I mean.

941
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,533
(Lively Italian)

942
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,118
Scusi. Bagaglio?

943
01:04:34,536 --> 01:04:36,246
Nada.

944
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:46,961
Il treno per Germania. Treno per
Brennero,  train to Germany.

945
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:51,136
3:50. Tre cinquanta.

946
01:04:53,722 --> 01:04:55,473
That's what I love
about the Mediterranean.

947
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,310
His attitude towards
work is relaxed.

948
01:04:58,727 --> 01:05:01,855
Not so grim as with us.
He didn't even want money.

949
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:05,025
His friends are more
important to him than his work.

950
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,777
We can still learn
something from that.

951
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,784
The train should have
been here long ago.

952
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:17,746
Dove e il treno?

953
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:22,455
Today no train. Sciopero.
Come se dice? Strike.

954
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,381
Wait. Wait! Who or
what is striking now?

955
01:05:28,924 --> 01:05:31,676
I want to tell you
something, good friend.

956
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:34,221
My name is Winkelmann.

957
01:05:34,596 --> 01:05:37,307
- and I don't have a sense for...
- Don't get worked up.

958
01:05:37,766 --> 01:05:39,517
Let's go to the airport now.

959
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:43,438
(Sings with great devotion)

960
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:47,567
Well, Mom would have
told us something about that!

961
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,780
Please stick your
mother on her hat.

962
01:05:52,322 --> 01:05:54,907
Not at the hat, Mrs.
Tietze. Not at the hat!

963
01:05:57,786 --> 01:06:01,456
It is recommended to
leave the aircraft via a slide.

964
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,791
Why, we've just gotten on.

965
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,503
Mom always says that
matter itself can't fly.

966
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,212
Oh really?

967
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,049
This armchair is absolutely
incapable of flying.

968
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,886
- He's flying anyway.
 - That's just crazy.

969
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,054
150 flying armchairs

970
01:06:16,346 --> 01:06:19,057
can one not even
imagine in a dream.

971
01:07:06,396 --> 01:07:07,980
Mom?

972
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,115
Mom?

973
01:07:29,127 --> 01:07:30,878
Mom?

974
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:35,675
(Again bumpy piano music)

975
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,319
Mom!

976
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:05,747
Ah, you! Has your wife
Dr. given you permission?

977
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:08,291
There's a man in my room.

978
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,210
You don't need to apologize.

979
01:08:10,502 --> 01:08:12,170
- Mom, there's a...
 - You are grown up.

980
01:08:12,504 --> 01:08:14,589
I'm always happy when
you have something planned.

981
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:17,383
- Who is this gentleman?
- That's Mr. Weber.

982
01:08:17,801 --> 01:08:19,803
- Mr. Weber? 
 - Yes.

983
01:08:20,178 --> 01:08:24,390
Mr. Weber! My
son would like to greet you.

984
01:08:25,058 --> 01:08:27,101
This really isn't necessary now.

985
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:32,649
This is Mr. Weber, my son.

986
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:36,945
- Good day.
- Please have a seat, Mr. Weber.

987
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:40,240
Thank you, but I
don't want to interrupt.

988
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,329
Mr. Weber is a musician. We
want to make music together.

989
01:08:46,788 --> 01:08:49,248
Dad's picture is on the wing.

990
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:52,377
My husband died 8 years ago.

991
01:08:52,836 --> 01:08:54,712
I still have the shirts.

992
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:57,340
Mr. Weber kindly
ironed your shirts.

993
01:08:57,716 --> 01:09:00,635
He found something
out there.  Tell me about it.

994
01:09:01,094 --> 01:09:03,763
One must turn up the
collar, the shirt collar.

995
01:09:04,222 --> 01:09:07,850
from back to front, iron
from the middle to the sides,

996
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:11,938
so that the opening doesn't
get narrower at the neck.

997
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:15,150
Mr. Weber is a great help to me.

998
01:09:15,567 --> 01:09:17,944
- Oh? 
- Yes, then...

999
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:27,829
Mr. Weber, shall I fry you some
purée this evening?

1000
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:31,625
If it could just
be a small thing?

1001
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:35,712
And without sauce, please.

1002
01:09:36,254 --> 01:09:40,508
Why is he ironing my shirts
and getting something roasted?

1003
01:09:41,176 --> 01:09:43,761
I didn't ask about
Mrs. Tietze either.

1004
01:09:44,179 --> 01:09:46,472
I have not roasted
anything for Mrs. Tietze.

1005
01:09:46,848 --> 01:09:48,015
And what about the
braided yeast bread?

1006
01:09:48,266 --> 01:09:50,268
I caught Mr. Weber in my bed!

1007
01:09:50,602 --> 01:09:52,437
Mr. Weber is my subtenant.

1008
01:09:56,775 --> 01:10:00,278
(The dice rolls away
loudly clattering)

1009
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,491
Excuse me, can I
find artists here?

1010
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:06,993
from the event of the
company Kunststoff-Meier?

1011
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:10,997
(Musical music)

1012
01:10:11,581 --> 01:10:14,750
(Singing) The
company Plastic-Meier

1013
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:17,504
lay plastic eggs.

1014
01:10:17,879 --> 01:10:21,507
made of polyvinyl chloride.

1015
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:26,972
Mr. Meier already
has the hang of it.

1016
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:32,056
He says, the world will become
more beautiful through PVC!

1017
01:10:33,061 --> 01:10:36,522
She asked him if she should
fry purée for him!

1018
01:10:37,065 --> 01:10:38,816
- Purée?

1019
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:40,902
- Your performance!
 - Why purée?

1020
01:10:41,194 --> 01:10:43,196
My mother has a lodger.

1021
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:47,534
(Singing) I have a sister, 
named Polyester.

1022
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:52,205
She's been sucking
for almost 9 years now.

1023
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:56,918
always the same
yellow plastic candy.

1024
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:02,382
That's top-notch stuff!

1025
01:11:02,924 --> 01:11:07,424
Yes, my little
sister, the polyester,

1026
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:12,805
the poly-ethy-lene!

1027
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:16,855
Ha!

1028
01:11:17,063 --> 01:11:18,856
Mr. Piesanelli! Mr.
Piesanelli!

1029
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:21,651
My mother can have as
many subtenants as she wants!

1030
01:11:22,068 --> 01:11:23,986
Where is that man with the goat?

1031
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:27,741
- Who?
- Mr. Piesanelli!

1032
01:11:28,283 --> 01:11:31,411
She is an adult. But
not like that. Not like that!

1033
01:11:31,953 --> 01:11:34,580
(Singing) We cultivate our
body with styrofoam.

1034
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,085
With real Polyplast and
polyamide.

1035
01:11:39,711 --> 01:11:44,211
And whether someone
loves me or not, I don't care.

1036
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,803
Mom used to be a singer.

1037
01:11:50,972 --> 01:11:55,267
He has a sister,
named Polyester.

1038
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:59,981
She's been sucking on
it for almost 9 years now.

1039
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:04,694
always the same
yellow plastic purée.

1040
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:09,407
That's top-notch stuff!

1041
01:12:10,033 --> 01:12:14,533
Yes, his little
sister, the polyester.

1042
01:12:16,122 --> 01:12:20,622
The P...V...C!

1043
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:25,381
Ha!

1044
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:32,347
(Scattered applause)

1045
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:41,815
"Uptight psychologist dances
her way to freedom."

1046
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,192
Ha-ha-ha!

1047
01:12:44,484 --> 01:12:47,737
Mom sings with him and
cooks for him every day.

1048
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,406
Margarethe!

1049
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:52,033
I listen carefully. Your
mother sings and cooks.

1050
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:54,410
What do you think of that?

1051
01:12:54,744 --> 01:12:57,121
(Sings) I have a sister,
named Polyester...

1052
01:12:57,497 --> 01:12:58,831
Good day, Mrs. Tietze.

1053
01:12:59,082 --> 01:13:00,875
- Ah, good day.
- Good day.

1054
01:13:01,209 --> 01:13:04,086
This is Mr. Winkelmann, Mr.
and Mrs. Schröder.

1055
01:13:04,629 --> 01:13:08,090
- Yes, then…goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1056
01:13:08,633 --> 01:13:10,760
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1057
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:16,724
(Clearing throat)

1058
01:13:17,058 --> 01:13:19,268
May Mr. Winkelmann
have a cup of tea?

1059
01:13:19,644 --> 01:13:21,437
Would you like a cup of tea?

1060
01:13:21,771 --> 01:13:24,190
Yes, gladly. And
some hot water, please.

1061
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:26,985
Why shouldn't he
be allowed any tea?

1062
01:13:27,402 --> 01:13:29,987
He could have just
taken something.

1063
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,951
What are you taking?

1064
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:37,829
I don't know how these
things are handled today.

1065
01:13:38,246 --> 01:13:41,415
At one cousin of mine,
the sister of Uncle Hoppe,

1066
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:45,170
no direct kinship, the one
got cold shocks back then.

1067
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:47,505
Mom, Mr. Winkelmann...

1068
01:13:47,797 --> 01:13:49,590
And very strong sedatives.

1069
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,968
That didn't help at all.

1070
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:56,844
We did visit her, before she
went into the Closed Ward.

1071
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,852
She wasn't allowed
any tea or coffee at all.

1072
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:03,480
- And no alcohol.
- Mom!

1073
01:14:03,855 --> 01:14:06,315
Mr. Winkelmann is
not under my care.

1074
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:08,484
That is very sensible.

1075
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,945
Please don't misunderstand me,

1076
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:14,366
but my daughter does
something like that just on the side.

1077
01:14:14,866 --> 01:14:18,494
My God! He's not
in treatment at all!

1078
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:21,790
I find that irresponsible.

1079
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:25,210
- But nowadays...
- Gerda?

1080
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:28,922
- Ah! Good day, Margarethe.
- That is Mr. Winkelmann.

1081
01:14:29,464 --> 01:14:33,926
Tietze. Gerda, do you know,
where this toothpaste tube was?

1082
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,929
I would rather not
know that right now.

1083
01:14:37,305 --> 01:14:39,557
Wash your hands and sit with us.

1084
01:14:44,104 --> 01:14:45,939
(Mrs. Tietze clears her throat)

1085
01:14:54,739 --> 01:14:57,825
- Well...
 - Mr. Winkelmann is the owner

1086
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:00,078
of a furniture and
decoration store.

1087
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:02,622
Ah, you have a shop?

1088
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:05,208
What's wrong with
Mr. Winkelmann?

1089
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:08,752
He is not in treatment,
but he has a shop.

1090
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:11,756
Maybe I'll still
get a cup of tea.

1091
01:15:12,173 --> 01:15:15,759
To be clear: Mr. Winkelmann
is not my patient.

1092
01:15:16,344 --> 01:15:18,679
He's not "crazy,"
as you like to put it.

1093
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:20,848
- Aha...
- The tea is gone.

1094
01:15:21,182 --> 01:15:23,434
You know where he is.

1095
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:27,313
And maybe your acquaintance
would like some peanuts!

1096
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,399
Cookies.

1097
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:32,026
(Choking cough)

1098
01:15:36,197 --> 01:15:38,824
He said "Cookies".

1099
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:41,286
Cookies used to be
simply in a cardboard box.

1100
01:15:41,619 --> 01:15:44,288
Now it's about plastic. That
makes things complicated.

1101
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,874
I think Mr. Winkelmann
isn't so interested in that.

1102
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:50,128
Is "Government Director Gröber"
a name you are familiar with?

1103
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:54,173
I had Mr. Gröber on my
side already in the fall of '77,

1104
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:57,010
but instead they
built a cultural center.

1105
01:15:57,385 --> 01:15:59,637
And we're up to
our necks in shit.

1106
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,432
- Can't we...?
- Not at the table!

1107
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:06,436
- Margarethe, get some more cookies.
- I don't know where they are.

1108
01:16:06,978 --> 01:16:10,648
Do I have to do everything
in this house alone?

1109
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:20,784
Say, what have you
dragged us into now?

1110
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:24,078
I thought you'd be
interested, who I'm with.

1111
01:16:24,537 --> 01:16:26,247
With whom what?

1112
01:16:26,581 --> 01:16:28,332
We travel and work together.

1113
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:30,668
(Mocking laughter)

1114
01:16:31,002 --> 01:16:32,795
Back then there were
at least professionals.

1115
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:34,881
Do you know what I mean?

1116
01:16:35,256 --> 01:16:37,466
They understood
something about their field.

1117
01:16:37,842 --> 01:16:40,970
Those were professionals
with expertise.

1118
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:44,641
Well, it was really
quite nice with you.

1119
01:16:45,141 --> 01:16:46,892
Do you want to leave already?

1120
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:49,479
I think I should
probably go now.

1121
01:16:49,854 --> 01:16:51,397
Wait!

1122
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,193
My mother would be very happy,

1123
01:16:55,568 --> 01:16:59,196
if you were also to come
to us in the next few days.

1124
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:04,281
(Sings) How beautiful,
how beautiful the earth is.

1125
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:10,124
That's what the
little birdies know...

1126
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,169
Thank you, Mrs. Winkelmann.
And perhaps again now

1127
01:17:13,628 --> 01:17:16,547
"They lift their wings so light and free,
and...

1128
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:19,926
(Sings) They lift their wings 
so light and free,

1129
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:21,761
Mom?

1130
01:17:22,011 --> 01:17:24,179
They lift their wings so light and free,

1131
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:27,725
And sing such melodies with glee

1132
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:31,354
And sing, and sing...

1133
01:17:31,896 --> 01:17:33,147
Mom!

1134
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:36,651
- In the aurel...
- F, Mrs. Winkelmann, F

1135
01:17:37,193 --> 01:17:39,862
- Yes, and?
- You sang an A flat.

1136
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:42,823
- Mom!
- And "L," Mrs. Winkelmann.

1137
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:46,369
- "In the <b>l</b>aurel" And...
- Mom! I find it wonderful,

1138
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,663
that you are making
music with Mr. Weber,

1139
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,665
but we have guests coming soon.

1140
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:52,583
We? You have guests.

1141
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:55,587
I told Tietez,
you'd be pleased...

1142
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,172
(Sings) That's what
the little birds know

1143
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,425
That's what the
little birds know.

1144
01:18:00,758 --> 01:18:02,050
We had discussed everything!

1145
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:04,929
- I suppose I may then... 
- You stay where you are.

1146
01:18:05,346 --> 01:18:07,097
What have we discussed?

1147
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:09,308
That I should invite
Tietze. In your name!

1148
01:18:09,642 --> 01:18:11,685
In God's name, I said.

1149
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,105
(The doorbell rings)

1150
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:22,279
(It rings again)

1151
01:18:29,495 --> 01:18:32,623
Hello! Please come in,
uh, come closer...inside.

1152
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,084
I, uh...Mom!

1153
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:38,421
Go ahead and
put it down already.

1154
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,550
And go into the living
room. I'll be there right away.

1155
01:19:10,745 --> 01:19:13,456
(Squealing)

1156
01:19:19,712 --> 01:19:22,881
- Shall I help you?
- No, thank you, I'm fine.

1157
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,428
Mom will excuse herself.

1158
01:19:27,762 --> 01:19:29,847
She is with a child.

1159
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:32,475
To a sick child.

1160
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:35,102
2 sick children.

1161
01:19:35,478 --> 01:19:37,438
From a friend.

1162
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:41,192
To a sick friend.

1163
01:19:41,484 --> 01:19:43,402
- Paul?
- Mom?

1164
01:19:43,736 --> 01:19:45,028
You should have
treated our guests

1165
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,699
at least be able
to offer a place.

1166
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:51,536
That's Mama. Mrs., uh,
Winkelmann. Those are...

1167
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:53,829
- Tietzes.
- Yes.

1168
01:19:54,163 --> 01:19:57,791
Oh, how delightful.
Please, Paul, be so kind.

1169
01:19:58,376 --> 01:20:00,628
Please sit down.

1170
01:20:05,216 --> 01:20:07,426
(Mrs. Winkelmann) Lovely
weather you've brought with you.

1171
01:20:07,802 --> 01:20:09,512
Yes.

1172
01:20:09,846 --> 01:20:12,723
Last year around this
time we were in Fischbach.

1173
01:20:13,224 --> 01:20:15,392
(Mrs. Winkelmann) Fish are all
poisoned these days, aren't they?

1174
01:20:15,768 --> 01:20:17,060
At Bensberg.

1175
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,564
My husband used to swim a lot.

1176
01:20:19,939 --> 01:20:22,733
- Bensberg.
- My husband died eight years ago.

1177
01:20:23,192 --> 01:20:25,694
Fourteen days ago, Government
director Gröbe died.

1178
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,905
Dr. Krakebusch died last week.

1179
01:20:28,197 --> 01:20:29,740
- Did you know him?
- No.

1180
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,784
He was honorary president of
the dog breeders' association.

1181
01:20:32,118 --> 01:20:34,370
There was a poodle
in the next house...

1182
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:36,706
Paul, Dr. Tietze
hasn't had any tea yet.

1183
01:20:37,081 --> 01:20:38,874
Without "Dr.", please.

1184
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:41,919
- Oh?
- My daughter is a psychologist.

1185
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,171
Psychologist (Diploma).

1186
01:20:44,547 --> 01:20:47,091
I thought Dr. Tietze
was a scientist.

1187
01:20:47,508 --> 01:20:49,843
Mom, Mrs. Tietze
treats mainly...

1188
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:51,345
She can explain that to me.

1189
01:20:51,554 --> 01:20:54,682
I advise people,  who are
struggling in their private lives

1190
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:58,144
- or professionally... 
- Would you like another cup?

1191
01:20:58,644 --> 01:21:01,313
No, thank you. My
daughter studied in Hamburg.

1192
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:03,733
- She dances very nicely too.
 - Oh, Mom!

1193
01:21:04,067 --> 01:21:06,486
- She's dancing! 
 - Mom studied singing.

1194
01:21:06,903 --> 01:21:08,946
Is your son still working?

1195
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,198
Since I withdrew,

1196
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:14,034
is my son CEO of our company.

1197
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:16,954
And founder of the department
for decorative fabrics.

1198
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:21,334
Wholesale or does he cut
more pieces off the bale?

1199
01:21:21,959 --> 01:21:23,961
- Mommy! 
- And Mom studied singing.

1200
01:21:24,295 --> 01:21:25,921
Ah, you sing?

1201
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:28,423
Oh yes. But then
when the boy came...

1202
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,761
A mother must be ready,  to
make sacrifices for her child.

1203
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,597
Isn't that right, my Pussi?

1204
01:21:35,014 --> 01:21:37,266
Your wife Mom has
a very beautiful voice.

1205
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:39,935
And what did your son study?

1206
01:21:40,311 --> 01:21:42,980
He has anyway not
gotten into the universities

1207
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:45,232
messing around with these
so-called "female students",

1208
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:48,528
who then later open a
massage parlor somewhere

1209
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,988
and claim they have patients.

1210
01:21:51,322 --> 01:21:53,449
My daughter?!

1211
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:55,701
What's wrong?

1212
01:21:56,035 --> 01:22:00,039
Have some, there are still some
Tietze here. I mean <i>treats</i>

1213
01:22:00,706 --> 01:22:03,417
- Mr. Tietze.
- Mrs. Winkelmann

1214
01:22:03,876 --> 01:22:06,628
You would delight us greatly
if you would sing for us.

1215
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:10,091
My God, I haven't
seen a grade in years.

1216
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:13,343
Just think, Mama, how
happy Mr. Weber would be.

1217
01:22:13,761 --> 01:22:16,180
But just something very short.

1218
01:22:16,597 --> 01:22:19,516
I would like Ms.
Winkelmann's hospitality.

1219
01:22:20,017 --> 01:22:22,269
- No longer strain.
- Mommy!

1220
01:22:22,645 --> 01:22:27,145
Mrs. Winkelmann performs
a song by Johannes Brahms.

1221
01:22:28,025 --> 01:22:29,985
- It is his Opus 6...
- Yes indeed!

1222
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:32,696
It is his Opus 6, Number 4

1223
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:36,283
in C major and
is titled "Hurrah!"

1224
01:22:41,414 --> 01:22:45,000
Johannes Brahms wrote
this song at the age of 19.

1225
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:49,797
and precisely with that
confidence, which is found in young people,

1226
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:52,967
but also in us more
mature people,

1227
01:22:53,384 --> 01:22:56,637
as a lighthearted
experience, life experience,

1228
01:22:57,221 --> 01:22:58,972
sounds.

1229
01:23:06,355 --> 01:23:10,855
(Sings) How beautiful,
how beautiful the earth is

1230
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:17,700
That's what the
little birds know.

1231
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:21,078
The birdies know that.

1232
01:23:21,537 --> 01:23:23,288
- I'm getting all...
- Shh!

1233
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:26,208
- I feel sick. -
What's wrong?

1234
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:28,377
Not bad, huh?

1235
01:23:28,669 --> 01:23:30,629
They lift their wings so light and free,

1236
01:23:30,963 --> 01:23:33,006
And sing such melodies with glee.

1237
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:34,884
Don't you want to
close the windows?

1238
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:38,220
- And sing, and sing!
 - I mean, because of the neighbors.

1239
01:23:38,721 --> 01:23:41,098
In the lauuuuu...

1240
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:43,434
That is completely pointless.

1241
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:46,437
Mom, Mrs. Tietze just
said it wouldn't be so bad.

1242
01:23:46,854 --> 01:23:48,939
- She didn't listen at all.
 - I did hear very well,

1243
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,567
- what you said about my daughter...
- Mom!

1244
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:53,110
- Paul!
- Mom!

1245
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,404
Your visitor would
like to say goodbye.

1246
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:58,115
- That was beautiful!
 - Absolutely beautiful.

1247
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:01,994
I don't recall
inviting these people.

1248
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:04,288
- If it were up to me...
- Mom, please!

1249
01:24:04,622 --> 01:24:06,874
We have our
wardrobe somewhere...

1250
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,001
Now it's getting really cozy!

1251
01:24:09,335 --> 01:24:10,794
We would be home already!

1252
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:13,339
Although I would have
been loath to forego it,

1253
01:24:13,714 --> 01:24:15,465
To hear Mrs. Winkelmann sing.

1254
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,052
I think it was a nice evening,

1255
01:24:18,469 --> 01:24:20,888
- So in general...
- Are you coming, Margarethe?

1256
01:24:21,305 --> 01:24:23,056
I would still like
to say goodbye.

1257
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,142
<i>That's not my hat.</i>

1258
01:24:27,353 --> 01:24:29,063
- Paul?
- Yes?

1259
01:24:31,482 --> 01:24:33,233
Ach!

1260
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:36,070
I guess I'm not
needed here anymore.

1261
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:36,111
I will probably no
longer be needed here.

1262
01:24:40,491 --> 01:24:43,577
(Romantic Waltz Music)

1263
01:24:44,078 --> 01:24:45,788
Pussi!
