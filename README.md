# subtitles
Some English subtitles for (mostly German) films.

## translated using LLM
I currently use `ollama run gemma2:27b` and [SubtitleEdit](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit) to translate the original subs automatically. LLMs don't understand the context and so there are lots of bad translations. It can't translate the jokes and often doesn't understand the cultural context. I try to fix these problems manaually. For that I look for songs, jokes, uncommon words. But I don't actually check every line. I usually buy the bluray version of the film. Don't ask me where to get the films, just buy the bluray.
