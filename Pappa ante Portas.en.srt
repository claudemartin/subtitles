1
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:11,761
(Gentle Music)

2
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:21,975
(Warlike Fanfare)

3
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,901
Where is my thingy,
uh, that, uh, that, uh...

4
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,695
- (Mrs. Lohse) What?
- The thingy! The black one!

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,905
The one with the addresses
and phone numbers.

6
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,492
(Mrs.

7
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,744
Lohse) No idea.

8
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,541
The dog is really lying in
a very inconvenient spot.

9
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,464
No, here it is. Oh, and the business
sections of the FAZ, are they in here?

10
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,675
- If you put them in.
- In here? No.

11
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:53,969
I got those for myself
yesterday...

12
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,182
They were up here.

13
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:02,227
Someone always throws
the newspapers around here.

14
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,981
I don't want anyone to take
anything away without asking me.

15
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:08,900
In 3 weeks, Mother will
have her 80th birthday.

16
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:12,946
- Do you hear me? We have to go there.
- I'm not deaf!

17
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:16,575
- And how old will your mother be?
- 80.

18
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:21,163
Friday, Saturday and Tuesday
are here. Monday of course not!

19
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,878
Here. Monday.

20
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:32,007
(Marching music)

21
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:39,473
And when is her birthday?

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,558
In 3 weeks.

23
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,644
Do we have to go there?

24
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:46,647
Yes. You also have a family,
besides.

25
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:49,191
The man goes hunting
with his club during the day,

26
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:52,027
and the family
sits in the cave and waits.

27
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:54,112
Your club.

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,198
What? Oh, right.

29
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,287
(Marching music)

30
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:20,181
(Marching music fades
into quiet, light music)

31
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,185
(Door opens)

32
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,480
- Is Dad gone?
- Yes.

33
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:32,147
(Whistles happily to himself)

34
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:38,615
(Telephone
is dialed)

35
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,793
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr. Klein

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,088
- Good morning, Mr. Lohse.
- Good morning, Mr. Moll.

37
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:56,216
- Good morning, Mr. Lohse.
- Good morning, Mr. Jeckel.

38
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,345
- Good morning. 
- Good morning, Sir, uh...

39
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,181
- Good morning, Mr. Lohse.
- Good morning.

40
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,017
Hello, Mrs. Pfeiffer!

41
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,935
How is the shipping department doing?

42
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,272
My God, how time flies!
And is the work fun?

43
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:13,692
- Yes, yes.
- What became of 

44
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,610
the little Mr. Dingaling?

45
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,863
What was his name,
this pale one? Hmmm...

46
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,824
You have it on your
tongue and can't think of it.

47
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:22,701
- Mr. Wiese?
- No.

48
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,833
It's much easier to
remember things from the past.

49
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:31,418
I know, for example, the
telephone number of my

50
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:34,504
parents, so before they
moved to Wiesbaden, 1950.

51
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:39,172
Uhm, I know that.
Uhm... 875586. No, 83.

52
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:45,682
- Good morning, Mr. Lohse.
- Good morning, Mr. Schambach.

53
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,350
Uhm, and the one of
my oldest sister. 341928.

54
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,900
- Have a nice day!
- Thank you very much.

55
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,110
- Good morning.
- Morning, Mrs. Lamprecht.

56
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,697
- Are the gentlemen from Osaka coming?
- Tomorrow at 11.

57
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,409
- Mail?
- On your desk.

58
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:35,523
Hello? This is Heinrich Lohse
from The Deutsche Röhren AG.

59
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:38,402
Yes, äh. Now we deliver the boiler

60
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,320
pipes, compression pipes, rain pipes,

61
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,406
extension pipes, pipes for heater and water...

62
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,491
Pardon?

63
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:47,577
Ah. Come again?

64
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,664
Oh, Sorry. I am... Then I have...

65
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:52,082
(Another phone rings)

66
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:54,334
Yes, I see.
I beg your pardon!

67
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,588
Herr Lohse? Here's a delivery - it arrived for you.

68
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,923
- I am coming.

69
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:05,387
Yes, that is the typewriter paper.

70
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:09,558
(Fanfare)

71
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,813
I'm just checking through again.

72
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,898
I still have a hundred-pack.

73
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,359
You don't have an overview there.

74
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,695
The sheet-by-sheet purchase of typewriter

75
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:23,780
paper is commercially irresponsible.

76
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,866
If we buy in bulk,

77
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:29,911
falls the price at 500,000
sheets by 35% and so on.

78
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,830
What is that?

79
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:34,374
Those are the erasers.
Would you please sign?

80
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,252
The General
Director expects you.

81
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:38,461
- Why?
- I don't know.

82
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,592
Oh, and make sure
that this is cleared away.

83
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:48,555
(Baroque brass music)

84
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:51,015
My dear Mr. Lohse.

85
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:55,683
(Continues baroque brass music)

86
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,773
Please have a seat.

87
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,486
Cigar?

88
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,073
Oh, thank you very much.

89
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,993
You have purchased
paper for our secretariats?

90
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,829
Writing paper.

91
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,875
Yes. With a saving
of over 50%.

92
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:19,669
Also, well, a bit in advance?

93
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:23,757
Yes. For about 40 years
with an average...

94
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:27,802
And, uh, is everything alright health-wise?

95
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,346
Oh yes, thank you.

96
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:32,599
You married rather late - and have a small child.

97
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:36,060
- Well, small...

98
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:40,728
- Can it sit and speak yet?
- My son is 16. He sits and speaks.

99
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,861
- What does he say then?
- Like what he says?

100
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,072
Well, how...

101
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,157
How does he call you?

102
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,453
- Papa.
- Charming, quite charming.

103
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,372
You should have more time
for the boy.

104
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:58,041
- Yes, yes.
- Mr., uh, Lohse,

105
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,043
I consider it my duty,

106
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,128
on the private life of
my closest employees

107
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,007
- To be considerate.
- That's new to me.

108
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,844
Dear Mr. Lohse, the Deutsche
Röhren AG owes you thanks.

109
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:13,511
I mean, it's time, that we think

110
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,936
together about,
uh... how you, uh...

111
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:20,355
can enjoy the well-deserved...

112
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:22,774
the fruits of your
well-deserved retirement.

113
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,612
- Do you want to imply...?
- We understand each other.

114
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,322
Keep your seat,
Mr. General Director.

115
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,157
For 37 years I've worked here.

116
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,785
We've turned a small, lousy
Mickey Mouse operation

117
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,080
into a big... a... what we are today.

118
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:37,747
And not you have anything to do with it...

119
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,626
- I don't want you to...-
I'm allowed to say that.

120
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,085
Please.

121
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:45,129
One moment!

122
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,339
I'm listening.

123
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,426
I'll get it right away.

124
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:51,595
You already mentioned the 
Mickey Mouse operation.

125
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,306
Ahh... yes! That's what I wanted to say!

126
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:57,142
I ALONE decide when I'm fed up 
with your tubes.

127
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,768
I already know when!

128
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,896
Now!

129
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:05,108
(Virtuoso violin playing)

130
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,654
(Exciting music)

131
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:54,866
(Sneaking footsteps, floorboards creak)

132
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,213
(Floorboards still creaking)

133
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,223
Ugh! My God, you scared me!

134
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,891
I live here.

135
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,145
But not now, at this time.

136
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:32,111
And I have
a surprise for you.

137
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:43,832
Good day, my boy.

138
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,166
(Loud music from headphones)

139
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,128
Where are you coming from?

140
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:49,713
Dieter!

141
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,424
Well, I'm eating now.

142
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,514
So! Excuse me.

143
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:01,599
I only have...

144
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,605
Well, I want to...

145
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,691
You put the book down now.

146
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:10,984
Dieter!

147
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,115
Well, I actually have
good news for you.

148
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,908
- From today...
- Aren't you having any Brussels sprouts?

149
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,577
Thank you, yes.

150
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,873
I actually have
a surprise.

151
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,667
It's no fun,
cooking for you.

152
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,630
- I have a surprise.
- A surprise?

153
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,425
From tomorrow on I will be
there completely for my family.

154
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:37,051
That's why you can
just keep eating.

155
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,763
My company, so Managing
Director Blume and I,

156
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,933
have us, uh, are we,
uh... are, uh, agreed,

157
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,728
that I will offer my working capacity
in the future less,

158
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:51,395
also rather not at all, 
concentrate on the company

159
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:54,360
and for that use my experience
more for...for my...

160
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:57,530
my home... and, ähm, the well-being...well, the

161
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:02,198
well-being of my family... dedicate...dedicate to dedicate.

162
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,955
Now eat,
so it doesn't get cold.

163
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,291
What are you saying there?

164
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:12,958
It is a new, more private activity.

165
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,465
What does that mean?

166
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:17,592
I am retired.

167
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,183
Then I'll get dessert.

168
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,354
I just threw in the towel!

169
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:34,021
(The doorbell rings)

170
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:37,362
<i>So you are always at home
all morning?</i>

171
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,739
Yes. And in the afternoon too.

172
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,910
<i>And where, what, what did you...
how do you think...</i>

173
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:45,745
I think I'll make my experience 
available to the household

174
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,624
- and the family.
- Ach...

175
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,875
What is that?

176
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,836
Pear Helene.

177
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,046
That's an apple though.

178
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,632
With chocolate sauce.

179
00:11:56,798 --> 00:11:59,759
Then it's not a Pear Helene,
but Apple Helene.

180
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,386
That doesn't exist at all.

181
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:05,557
An apple is an apple
and a pear is a pear.

182
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,767
Leave it, if you don't like it.

183
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,938
- I do like it.
- Then eat it.

184
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:13,773
I am eating it. But not
under the wrong name.

185
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,318
- That's Elisabeth.
- What's wrong?

186
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,488
That's Elisabeth.

187
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:23,158
(Electrical buzzing)

188
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,707
Do you know what I've
been thinking about?

189
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:32,792
Well, what is it?

190
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:40,466
It's not so easy these days for a

191
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,178
woman to run a modern private household.

192
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:47,390
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeaaah.

193
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:50,893
And I've decided, that in
order to relieve you, Chairman.

194
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:55,065
..well, Head of the, uh, uh,

195
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,193
that I will now take responsibility
for the household.

196
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,278
Yes, my darling.

197
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:02,363
Did you want to say anything else?

198
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:06,701
- No.
- Well, then good night.

199
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,705
So!

200
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:32,143
Renate?

201
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,979
Renate!

202
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,482
(Phone rings)

203
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,233
(Mrs.

204
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,819
Lohse) Lohse.
Hello, Rita!

205
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:45,948
You, uh, is something wrong?

206
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,952
No, no, it's time.

207
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:55,287
You, it...it's alright.

208
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:58,628
But I have to talk to you then.

209
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:00,463
Yes.

210
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,883
No, you tell me first.

211
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:11,345
Yes. No, right now
it's not so...

212
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:17,230
Don't let me bother you. You
can talk on the phone in peace.

213
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:21,067
You know...you, uh, I...

214
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,820
Um, I wanted to...
But it's not so...

215
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:32,453
It, uh, it also has
time until tomorrow.

216
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,082
Yes, then...
then I'll call you, uh...

217
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:38,960
Yes.

218
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:42,672
You, I'll call you
back later.

219
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,757
What is that?

220
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,427
These are the things
for the clothes collection.

221
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:49,512
My winter coat?! Come on!

222
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,682
You already had it when we
met.

223
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:56,727
The coat is still in perfect
condition! I'll give it to Dieter!

224
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:59,564
He's looking forward to it,
when he inherits Dad's coat.

225
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,650
- Renate!
- He's over the moon with joy.

226
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,654
Why do you always
throw away all my things?

227
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,447
The dog needs to go out.

228
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:09,657
Darling, that's not an
answer to my question.

229
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,161
And the dog has to go
out, when I think it's right.

230
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:14,829
Wutz!

231
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,044
Wutz, you come here
now to your master!

232
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,632
- (Dog growls)
- Wutz, here's your master!

233
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,551
- Good morning, Mr. Lohse.
- Good morning.

234
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:32,638
Wutz! Here's your master!

235
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,517
- (Growling)
- Stupid dog.

236
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,272
Well? Did he do something?

237
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,818
He, uh, well, you can't
really see that well.

238
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,446
- I'm going shopping then.
- No. Give it here.

239
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:52,033
- I find that really nice...
- We discussed that.

240
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,410
That falls within my
area of responsibility.

241
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,830
You don't know anything about what I...

242
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,750
Your husband was 17 years
Head of the purchasing department.

243
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,474
I put the cans over here.

244
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:19,435
- What would you like? What kind of cans?
- I would like...

245
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,021
2 fish dumplings
and 1 gravy.

246
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,565
You don't have those
put out. Yes, please?

247
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,276
- 1 caraway cheese.
- They would have to be there then.

248
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,863
My name is Lohse.
I shop here.

249
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,243
But I put them next to
the potato salad.

250
00:16:35,368 --> 00:16:39,622
- Then they were picked up. Right?
- 1 caraway cheese and tomatoes.

251
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:43,042
- If they are gone.
- I want to shop here.

252
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,587
Who was supposed to
pick them up? Yes, please?

253
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,631
- I would like to buy here...
- But I was here!

254
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:51,592
- Then you stand somewhere else.
- 1 caraway cheese, please.

255
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,637
- Otherwise you would be there.
- Where then? Yes?

256
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:58,224
Well, where you put them.

257
00:16:58,391 --> 00:17:00,726
1 caraway cheese, please,
and 2 pounds of tomatoes.

258
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,564
I always put them
here. What is it now?

259
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:07,358
My name is Lohse, I
would like to shop here.

260
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,944
Tell me also, what it should be?

261
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:13,989
We are not going to get
anywhere with this tone.

262
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:16,784
So, we have 2 options.

263
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,120
Either I read you the whole list

264
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:21,205
of what I need, or we go through

265
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,292
everything
individually one by one.

266
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,668
Please?

267
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:27,795
So then, 1 jar of mustard.

268
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,384
1.29.

269
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,805
1.29. Will it be cheaper,
if I take several at once?

270
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:41,472
At 10 glasses you
save... 60 Pfennig.

271
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,187
That sounds better. And at 50?

272
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:52,570
- Mr. Lohse!
- Oh, Mrs. Mielke!

273
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:56,699
- Aren't you going to the office today?
- I, uh, yes, uh, no.

274
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:59,201
Not directly.

275
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,287
My activity currently relates
more to the domestic area.

276
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:02,997
You're retired!

277
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:06,500
That's one way to put
it...that could be said, yes.

278
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,586
Could you hold the bag for me?

279
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:11,797
Yes, gladly, but then I
must also immediately...

280
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:15,092
Thank you.

281
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,928
So. Then I'll just...

282
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:19,138
I would also have
a cup of beef broth.

283
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,224
I could heat that up for you.

284
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,060
- Mrs. Mielke...
- It would be very quick.

285
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:27,605
- Maybe another time.
- But this stays between us.

286
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:31,400
My sister is in such
things always a bit...

287
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,279
Although...that with her husband
was just gossip back then.

288
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,865
He died in a
perfectly natural way.

289
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,743
But one doesn't have to necessarily...

290
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:43,537
No, no. So then...
Ha! That is...

291
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,040
Mr. Lohse wanted
to ask you something.

292
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:49,293
I said that you weren't here.
- I must leave right away...

293
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,671
What did you want
to ask me, Mr. Lohse?

294
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:54,674
Oh, that can wait. I
have to figure out my

295
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:56,717
life, the means, my
means of sustenance first...

296
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,553
Goodbye.

297
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,809
Brigitte, will you come here for a moment?

298
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:08,979
Renate!

299
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,158
Renate?

300
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:26,872
Stop!

301
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,833
Put that back where it was!

302
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,546
How did you get in here?

303
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:35,631
Through the front door.

304
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:40,299
- What's your name?
- Kleinert. I clean here.

305
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:44,682
Well, look at that. 
My name is Lohse.

306
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:47,601
We'll be working
together in the future...

307
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,773
No, uh, scratch that.

308
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,609
Housework requires  strict

309
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,652
organization if it is to be effective.

310
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,197
- Do you have that?
- Yes sir, Mr. Lohse.

311
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,826
The top principle is: 
"First think, then act."

312
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,498
That's Mrs. Kleinert, our cleaning lady. My wife.

313
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:12,001
Mrs. Kleinert, we can 
then go to the curtains.

314
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:14,044
I don't want to
be interrupted now.

315
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:16,589
I'm in a meeting with Mrs. Kleinert.

316
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:18,257
It would be very kind if you could schedule

317
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,386
an appointment for me afterwards.

318
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:25,014
- Uh ... what was that last?
- What?

319
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:27,099
What I said last.

320
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,018
- "Act. Then act". 
- Yes.

321
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:31,854
- By the way, ma'am, uh...
- Kleinert.

322
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:34,982
I will lend a hand,
until you are trained.

323
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,485
I want to set a good example.

324
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:42,073
What principle has
guided your work so far?

325
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,326
Yeah...I would have made
the beds now.

326
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:49,497
Completely wrong. You finish your task in the

327
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:53,042
stairwell, I'll make the beds and you join me later.

328
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:56,837
- So then!
- Yes sir.

329
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:05,550
(Birds chirping)

330
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:20,486
- Where are the beds?
- I took them out to air...

331
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,700
Ma'am, uh, Kleinert, our work

332
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,119
schedule is undergoing a change.

333
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:30,329
We will continue in the garden first.

334
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,417
In unforeseen events one

335
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,669
must adapt to the circumstances.

336
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:40,589
Uh...best if you remove
the top sheet now

337
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,675
from the thingamajig,
the, uh, climbing rose.

338
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:44,343
Yes, Mr.

339
00:21:45,553 --> 00:21:47,471
Lohse.

340
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,851
And please stay calm.

341
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:53,936
We had a very important
message for you. (Mr. Lohse) Oh?

342
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:56,855
(Muffled harmonium sounds)

343
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:58,983
No, Rita, you have no idea!

344
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,320
Sorry, the doorbell
rang. I'll call you back.

345
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,949
These are our beds. I was
just quickly with Mrs. Kleinert...

346
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:11,203
And those are the Glöckners. They
have an important message.

347
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,081
We don't subscribe to any magazines.

348
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,124
- Is this about magazines?
- No.

349
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,960
- No.
- No. Will you take that from me?

350
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:20,879
I'll take care of it.

351
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:24,091
(Still muffled harmonium sounds)

352
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,680
Please, sit down.

353
00:22:33,726 --> 00:22:36,979
Excuse me.
My wife is a bit suspicious.

354
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:39,064
This is not meant personally.

355
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,735
May I offer you something?

356
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:44,820
According to calculations by the

357
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,907
internationally renowned Professor

358
00:22:48,074 --> 00:22:52,574
Pirkheimer, the Venus moon Tetra has

359
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,998
left its orbit and is now racing towards Earth.

360
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:58,792
Its impact
is imminent.

361
00:22:58,918 --> 00:23:02,296
This means
the end of our planet.

362
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:05,799
You know, that's very
inconvenient here at the moment.

363
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,426
I thought you had...

364
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,555
Only people who are clean

365
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,223
inside and out have nothing to fear.

366
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,890
This handcrafted brush made from pure

367
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,523
natural bristles, I could let you have for 28.50 DM.

368
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,858
That's very kind,
but I think...

369
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,404
For 32 DM we recommend
this bath additive.

370
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,990
- No, no.
- Even without cash.

371
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,783
If you please want to sign?

372
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,117
No, no...

373
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,078
You will receive our
delivery then monthly - on

374
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:37,998
invoice with 2% discount.
- Or the amounts will

375
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,710
be debited from your
account, with 5% discount.

376
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,629
If you don't decide
immediately, that's fine.

377
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:46,048
We would then always
come every Thursday.

378
00:23:46,215 --> 00:23:48,550
Ah? Where do I have to sign?

379
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,014
The delivery for Lohse.

380
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,224
That's getting a bit much for me now.

381
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:59,269
- But it's your order.
- What? Ah yes, yes.

382
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:02,273
(Mr. Lohse) You
can put it right here.

383
00:24:03,691 --> 00:24:06,068
- Here?
- Yes, please.

384
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,655
- Goodbye, boss.
- Goodbye.

385
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:11,365
What was that message?

386
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:14,159
That was a message
from Professor

387
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:16,996
Pirkheimer about the impending impact.

388
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:20,040
It might be the end, the

389
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,794
upcoming end of our civilization.

390
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,880
You haven't signed anything, have you?

391
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:29,508
I, uhm, no. It will all be charged.

392
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,594
What will be charged?

393
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,679
Uh...brushes.

394
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:37,391
Root brushes and, uh,
natural bath additive.

395
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:39,601
1 ton of bath additive?!

396
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,564
No. That's mustard. 150 jars.

397
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,483
Mustard! Well, thank God! The world is going under,

398
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,028
but we have mustard, root brushes and bath additive.

399
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:50,321
What's going on?

400
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,823
Your father wants to give you something.

401
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,325
What?

402
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,993
Ah, yes.

403
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,249
This is my... this was my best coat.

404
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,169
In this coat I met your mother.

405
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:06,712
Try it on.

406
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:11,379
(Romantic violin music)

407
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,221
Perfect.

408
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,726
You can sew on the button.

409
00:25:20,893 --> 00:25:23,687
Great! Turn around once.

410
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,649
It fits perfectly.

411
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,485
If my father had given me
such a coat!

412
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:33,572
Are you happy? Say something!
And the color looks so good on you!

413
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,825
You can wear this
to Grandma's birthday.

414
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,328
- Say something!
- Great...

415
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,957
- Look, a squirrel.
- Look, a squirrel!

416
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,501
A squirrel!

417
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:50,168
I unpack my marital problems
and what does my girlfriend say?

418
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:52,966
Look, a squirrel!

419
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,846
I have been married very
comfortably for 17 years.

420
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,180
(Funny noise)

421
00:25:58,347 --> 00:26:00,974
I had the household, then came Dieter, and Heinrich

422
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,854
was well looked after in his company all day long.

423
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,064
Never bothered either.

424
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:09,775
- But you did whine.
- Whine?!

425
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:11,443
That he never has time.

426
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,614
I didn't know what it's
like, when he has time.

427
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,699
Then find yourself a job.

428
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,827
Couples are only happy
when one never has time.

429
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,834
I made us something warm.

430
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:29,128
What is that?

431
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:31,088
Königsberger Klopse from a can.

432
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:33,173
Königsberg was the capital of...

433
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,009
I know.

434
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:39,972
- How's school going?
- It's okay.

435
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,894
You are almost just barely born and

436
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,022
we are already sitting together for dinner.

437
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:54,028
At your age I was very
interested in sports.

438
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,572
- For top athletes.
- Hm-hm.

439
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:58,657
Sit up straight, boy.

440
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:03,495
Who is...
whom do you admire so much?

441
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,040
- Who do you think is great?
- Michael Jackson.

442
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,918
Michael Jackson.

443
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:12,630
He was world boxing champion
in the light heavyweight division.

444
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:17,297
But then Eddie Alersmeier beat him. 1952.

445
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,887
That's something I have a memory for.

446
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:23,724
What does a boxer live
on when he gets old?

447
00:27:23,891 --> 00:27:26,935
Michael Jackson is giving a concert in
the exhibition hall the day after tomorrow.

448
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,146
That's the chance!

449
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:35,982
You, uh, the young lady,
the one you met recently, uh...

450
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,574
is that yours, is that, uh...
is she from your class?

451
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,074
Hm-hm.

452
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:47,623
And, uh, if you... so, if you're together,

453
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,418
how, uh, is it, when you're like, uh...

454
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,713
Look, your mother and I...

455
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,841
we weren't, born

456
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,843
old, so to speak.

457
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,389
Uh... the most important
thing is that one, uh...

458
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,474
Especially when you are young,

459
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:08,143
there is the body, uh...

460
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,730
that's quite natural, uhm...

461
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,481
so, the physical, I mean.

462
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:17,148
Men are... and women
too... Think about it!

463
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:22,070
Precisely, because I mean well. Did we understand each other?

464
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,868
Hm-hm.

465
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:27,038
Nice that you talked
openly about everything.

466
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,753
Women have their good sides too.

467
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,378
Women have their good sides too.

468
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,256
My mother went to school back there.

469
00:28:37,423 --> 00:28:41,923
My brother-in-law used to
live here. But in the back.

470
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:47,887
27., 28., 29., 30., 1., 2.

471
00:28:48,851 --> 00:28:51,895
Where is the 3rd?

472
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,814
(Sounds of voices approaching)

473
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:55,899
Where is the 3rd?

474
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,611
Where is the 3rd?

475
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,739
(All the ladies talk at the same time)

476
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,910
Go ahead to the living
room then. I'll make tea.

477
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:13,334
Ah, Mr. Lohse!
Nice that we finally see you too.

478
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,961
I'm just getting an overview of the

479
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:17,712
available newspaper material. 
- Heinrich!

480
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,258
Did it have to be today of all days?

481
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:23,802
No, with timely information, I would have

482
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,347
reserved the use of the living space for you today.

483
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,517
(Mrs. Lohse) Take a seat.

484
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,436
Let's not be disturbed. If it
gets mixed up, I can start again!

485
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:35,355
- That's chewing gum. 
- That was the FRANKFURTER!

486
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,317
What a strong man you
have there, Mrs. Lohse!

487
00:29:38,484 --> 00:29:40,652
Aren't you feeling well, Brigitte?

488
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,447
Heinrich, didn't you want to
go for a walk with the dog?

489
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:45,532
No. That wasn't mentioned.

490
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,785
Mrs.

491
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,037
Bredenbek, I must ask you to stand up.

492
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:51,663
You are sitting on the culture
section of the WELT. (Clattering)

493
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,749
No, that's not 
the culture section.

494
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:56,001
But I had it 
put here somewhere.

495
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:59,296
Please look under you.
Maybe someone is sitting on it.

496
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:02,174
- Please stay... 
- I must insist!

497
00:30:02,341 --> 00:30:04,051
Will you help me, Heinrich?

498
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:06,511
I knew it!

499
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:10,307
It doesn't matter! I have time!

500
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:12,350
Why don't you throw away
these newspapers?

501
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:14,937
I didn't know that you were
into your cultural vultures...

502
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,522
No one ever looks in there again.

503
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,315
How am I supposed to
get the housework going...

504
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:20,859
I want to see you when I
throw away the newspapers...

505
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,404
I want to know, who drinks
coffee when and where!

506
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,614
What kind of impression does that make!

507
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:28,658
You are also interested in
having order...

508
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:31,370
What's gotten into you anyway?

509
00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:33,163
That's Püppi.

510
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,794
(Muffled noise)

511
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:40,879
Waiter?

512
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,050
They don't like us here.

513
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:49,805
Waiter, may we perhaps
bring them SOMETHING?

514
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,141
Waiter?

515
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,226
Have the gentlemen ordered?

516
00:30:54,393 --> 00:30:57,437
Yes, for some time now. We
would like two calves' livers.

517
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,608
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- Oh, and anything else?

518
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,778
Homemade chicken soup, but I
would advise against that as well.

519
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:05,946
And fish?

520
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:09,533
- Then I'll take the hunter's steak.
- As you wish.

521
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,743
- Do you have pear Helene?
- Heinrich!

522
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,079
That is our specialty.

523
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:16,581
We serve natural pear
puree with vanilla sauce.

524
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,667
Pear Helene is a poached pear with

525
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:20,377
vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.

526
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:23,338
Ours is with vanilla sauce
and is always very popular.

527
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,549
Your pear is simply not
a pear Helene.

528
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:28,593
- How about the apple pie?
- No, thank you.

529
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,472
So 1 hunter's steak.

530
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,807
If I hear
pear Helene one more time,

531
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:36,685
I throw myself down
and bite into the carpet!

532
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:38,103
Ach was!

533
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,105
I have imagined your
retirement differently.

534
00:31:40,272 --> 00:31:43,108
This is my first retirement!
I am still practicing!

535
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:47,237
I just thought... My God,
what are men insensitive!

536
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,781
Everyone here can understand you.

537
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,616
Unfortunately I don't
understand you at all.

538
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,701
- 1 Jägerspieß.
- Thank you very much.

539
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:55,370
If you should eat right
now, it is not very hot.

540
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,915
- And mine?
- You didn't order anything.

541
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,585
- Then I'll have the chicken soup.
- Chicken soup.

542
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,551
Give it here, I'll do it.

543
00:32:09,718 --> 00:32:12,053
Maybe you'll let me do
something alone sometime!

544
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,848
Here you go, here you go!

545
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:26,359
I didn't say anything.

546
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,166
Order yourself a
hunter's skewer.

547
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:42,709
That's mine.
That's right here with me.

548
00:32:45,754 --> 00:32:50,254
Have you ever seen what it
looks like when you do that?

549
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:52,427
What am I supposed to do?

550
00:32:54,763 --> 00:32:56,806
- When am I supposed to do that?
- Always.

551
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:58,809
You've already done it 3 times here.

552
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:01,186
Then that's
a lovable peculiarity.

553
00:33:01,353 --> 00:33:03,271
Do you know what you're doing?

554
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,899
- What?
- That.

555
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:08,234
May I clear the table?

556
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:11,696
No, we're not finished yet.

557
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:15,742
Should I dissolve myself then?
- It would have

558
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,828
been quite fabulous if Mr. Director Lohse had

559
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,706
left the director
in the company - and only Mr.

560
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:24,793
Lohse would have remained.
- Only Mr. Lohse? "Only"?

561
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,587
I am Heinrich Lohse, happily married, ha-ha!, with one

562
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:31,091
child and a regular income. What does "only" mean here?

563
00:33:31,258 --> 00:33:34,886
I just want us to be at home now instead of

564
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,182
sitting in your company. Quiet and peaceful.

565
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,352
- Old and fat!
- That wouldn't be the worst thing.

566
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,605
I will try my best.

567
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:51,111
Excuse me,
my name is Drögel.

568
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:53,029
I became an unwilling
witness of your conversation.

569
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,825
- I am in a hurry.
- I liked how you...

570
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,328
There are ladies missing
everywhere who sometimes...

571
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,414
Excuse me, but...

572
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:04,499
We are a well-known confectionery company, the

573
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:09,046
company Riegel and Klotz, formerly Seidenmann, Bielefeld.

574
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,589
Well, uhm, yes, yes.

575
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:13,216
We need ladies with joy in the matter.

576
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,427
May I offer you my card...? Excuse me.

577
00:34:15,594 --> 00:34:18,597
I had it in my hand all along.

578
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:19,931
Thank you very much.

579
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,060
I would be delighted to hear from you.

580
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,729
One chicken soup.

581
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,405
(Door opens and slams shut)

582
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,949
- Heinrich?
- Don't worry. Everything is fine.

583
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,159
I don't make beds, buy groceries,

584
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:42,329
and only go up and down the stairs.

585
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:44,873
- If I may! - Come closer.

586
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,251
Excuse me, Heinrich.
That wasn't what I meant.

587
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,755
I know, it's not easy for you either.

588
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:53,965
Maybe I should have helped you more.

589
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,427
- What's wrong?

590
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,306
- You could have your own kingdom here with us, with your family.

591
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:02,390
- Aha?
- Just for you.

592
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,851
Where no one... where no one bothers

593
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,104
you, where you can be loud sometimes.

594
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,855
Loud?

595
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,442
Where you can be the way you want to be.

596
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,236
If we tidy up a bit here...

597
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:17,322
That could be very...

598
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:19,866
It could be quite cozy.

599
00:35:22,202 --> 00:35:24,120
Something like crafts or something.

600
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,292
And all this is going away.
Then you have space for models.

601
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,879
- Hm...
- Model building...or something like that.

602
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,382
Are there gentlemen retired
everywhere here in the cellars?

603
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:38,635
Here you also have light...
and water...

604
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,472
Well, what do you think?

605
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,768
Can't I just stay up there?

606
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,237
(Mrs.

607
00:35:57,404 --> 00:35:58,738
Lohse) The Mielke sisters are coming now.

608
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,033
They'll pick me up. (In a
shrill voice) Oh, Mrs. Lohse!

609
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,287
I didn't know your husband was home!

610
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,372
Do you want to say hello?

611
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:11,543
No. I'll stay lying here.
Very still and peaceful.

612
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:15,463
Coffee is in the thermos flask,
sausage rolls are in the fridge.

613
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,050
Did you hear?

614
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,135
I heard it!

615
00:36:20,302 --> 00:36:21,594
(The doorbell rings)

616
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,680
(The door opens)

617
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:26,850
- Good day, Mrs. Mielke.
- Good day, Mrs. Lohse!

618
00:36:27,017 --> 00:36:30,729
(The ladies talk all at once)

619
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:35,396
(A blackbird sings)

620
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,072
Ach, Mrs. Lohse! I didn't
know your husband was home!

621
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,157
(In a falsetto voice)
Good day, Mrs. Mielke!

622
00:36:42,324 --> 00:36:45,285
(Clears throat, then normal
voice) Nice that you're here again...

623
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:48,079
- Are you sick?

624
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,498
- My husband just lay down for a bit.

625
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:53,001
We took some time off.
Very sensible.

626
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:55,086
That's not quite right,
Mrs.

627
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,798
Mielke.

628
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,549
I am retired.
Mr. Lohse is retired!

629
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,635
We didn't know that at all.

630
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:05,138
- Why don't you come along?
- Yes, why not?

631
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:06,848
No, no...

632
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:10,184
We need more men for our cultural events.

633
00:37:10,352 --> 00:37:13,563
That's really very kind, but

634
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,483
my wife thought I should...

635
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,151
My husband doesn't like poetry readings.

636
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:21,946
- That's something completely new!
- We did discuss,

637
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,574
that you wanted to stay
home comfortably sometime.

638
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,620
Well, he can still do that!
Mr. Lohse!

639
00:37:28,787 --> 00:37:31,247
Well then I'll just put
something on quickly.

640
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:37,587
(Heavy string music, Coughing)

641
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:47,472
(Unintelligible)

642
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:52,139
(Clears throat and coughs again)

643
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,064
My most esteemed ladies
and gentlemen.

644
00:37:56,231 --> 00:38:00,360
For the 2nd time this year
we have gathered today

645
00:38:00,527 --> 00:38:02,820
to an event of our
cultural circle gathered.

646
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:04,906
(Clears throat)

647
00:38:05,073 --> 00:38:08,409
This afternoon is dedicated
to contemporary literature.

648
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,663
It is a great pleasure,
that the most important

649
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,625
representative, living representative,
the most

650
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,087
important, livingest, so still alive representative
of

651
00:38:19,254 --> 00:38:21,756
modern poetry could be found, here with us
to read from his work.

652
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,717
A man,
who has made literary

653
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,262
history, a name that has become
a

654
00:38:27,429 --> 00:38:29,347
term worldwide: - Lothar Frohlein.
- Frohwein.

655
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,475
Frohwein.

656
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:42,735
(Silence, only Frohwein's
leather jacket squeaks)

657
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:54,247
(Silence, only the creaking
of the leather can be heard)

658
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,879
(Expectant silence)

659
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:07,631
At the beginning I will read 22
poems from the cycle "Farewell".

660
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:13,349
- Then...
- A little louder, please!

661
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,977
Then 8 ballads from my early creative period,

662
00:39:16,144 --> 00:39:20,189
followed by the sonnet collection "The 12 Months".

663
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:24,857
Hereupon 3 chapters
from the novel

664
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:29,115
"Pedokles" and finally
a tragedy in 3

665
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,244
acts with the title:
"Goethe in Halberstadt”".

666
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:36,415
Then we will have the
opportunity, to speak to each other.

667
00:39:58,228 --> 00:39:59,562
Melosine...

668
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,356
(Hiccup)

669
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:06,236
(Hiccup again)

670
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:11,825
(Hiccup)

671
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,634
Is that part of the recital?

672
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:32,011
A piece of sugar always helps me.

673
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,182
- He should hold his breath.
- What do you mean?

674
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,601
One would have to startle him.

675
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,561
Or ask something that distracts him.

676
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,980
Psst!

677
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:43,940
(Still hiccuping)

678
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:45,858
Excuse me,
if I interrupt you.

679
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,402
Heinrich!

680
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:48,861
(Hiccup)

681
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,157
What did you have
for dinner last night?

682
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:57,287
Uhm...Kohlrabi.

683
00:40:57,454 --> 00:41:00,415
Steamed kohlrabi with fish

684
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:05,044
sticks and... tartar sauce.

685
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,468
Melosine...

686
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,721
Krawehl, Krawehl!

687
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:17,432
Dew-hazy glim by the Muses' grove!

688
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,268
Haze groved dew by the Muses' glim!

689
00:41:20,435 --> 00:41:22,979
Krawehl, Krawehl!

690
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:24,939
(Hiccup)

691
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:30,278
(Romantic piano music)

692
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:51,924
(Music overlays
the various conversations)

693
00:42:09,901 --> 00:42:13,446
I always thought before, that
we were living past each other.

694
00:42:13,613 --> 00:42:16,741
You've told me that 3 times already.

695
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:19,452
I told him what I meant, and

696
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,912
I thought, he had understood!

697
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,625
He doesn't throw beds out
the window anymore, no!

698
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:29,754
Now he's discussing
with Lothar Frohlein!

699
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:33,341
- One sausage, for the lady.
- Thank you very much.

700
00:42:33,508 --> 00:42:36,219
Maybe there's also
something else besides men.

701
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,347
What do you mean by that?

702
00:42:39,514 --> 00:42:42,517
One shouldn't
drive oneself crazy.

703
00:42:42,684 --> 00:42:44,435
Let them do
whatever they want.

704
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,939
There are such beautiful
men..., uh, possi-bilities.

705
00:42:48,106 --> 00:42:51,484
Compared to women,
men are really uninteresting.

706
00:42:51,651 --> 00:42:54,278
Pretend he isn't even there.

707
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:56,322
Ha!

708
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,497
Caught you,
my darling! Haha!

709
00:43:04,664 --> 00:43:08,918
- That was brilliant.
- Thank you very much! Goodbye, Rita.

710
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:13,548
I thought - I knew you were in town - it

711
00:43:13,715 --> 00:43:17,385
would be nice if we met somewhere. By chance.

712
00:43:17,552 --> 00:43:21,931
I won't bother either.
Pretend I'm not even here.

713
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,726
- Do you have a wish?
- One pot of coffee.

714
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,228
- 1 Coffee.
- Do you know who's sitting there?

715
00:43:27,395 --> 00:43:28,813
Where?

716
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,149
There! The lady with the
light bonnet. That's Lisbeth!

717
00:43:32,317 --> 00:43:35,403
- Lisbeth Prenzler!
- Heinrich!

718
00:43:36,988 --> 00:43:38,906
Well, my fatty?

719
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:42,285
Come on, put your glasses
on! It's me! Heinrich Lohse!

720
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:45,121
How are you? You've gained a
bit of weight. It suits you though.

721
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:48,582
- Is your husband here too?
- I'm not married.

722
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,793
We visited you in Hamburg!

723
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,213
I live in Würzburg.
For 36 years.

724
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,674
No. Your son studied in
Hamburg and lived with you.

725
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,219
- I don't have a son.
- But, Lisbeth!

726
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,304
My name is Käthe.

727
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,891
Oh...

728
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,770
Käthe...

729
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:12,273
You know what, I'm going now.

730
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,358
I'll call you.

731
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:24,535
So, I wouldn't have recognized
Lisbeth again. How is she doing?

732
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,664
Uh...okay. She lives now
in Würzburg. Where is Rita?

733
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,750
She had to go.
I have to hurry too.

734
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:33,294
You certainly still have
something planned.

735
00:44:33,461 --> 00:44:36,589
Yes. But if you ask me,
I would accompany you.

736
00:44:36,756 --> 00:44:39,467
As a dutiful husband.
As a little mouse.

737
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:46,682
So! So...
what do you want to buy?

738
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,227
Oh, I want to
look around first.

739
00:44:49,394 --> 00:44:52,021
Look around... And where do
we want to look around first?

740
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,066
Ah, that's interesting. Look!

741
00:44:55,233 --> 00:44:56,859
These are these pipe systems.

742
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:00,905
We sold a lot of those
to Mexico. And to Cuba.

743
00:45:01,072 --> 00:45:03,699
I didn't even know, that
we were exhibiting here.

744
00:45:03,825 --> 00:45:08,079
The whole system works
without backflow preventers.

745
00:45:08,246 --> 00:45:09,914
Interesting, isn't it?

746
00:45:11,499 --> 00:45:14,710
The opening for the
overflow must be at the back.

747
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,130
It is hard to see.

748
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:23,594
Yes! You can see it from here.

749
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,180
Very interesting shopping route.

750
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:46,367
Renate?

751
00:46:09,015 --> 00:46:11,392
When are we going home?

752
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:14,436
I need another pair of
shoes for Mom's birthday.

753
00:46:14,604 --> 00:46:18,274
We already bought shoes.
The brown ones with the studs.

754
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:21,235
- That was 6 years ago.
- Yes, exactly.

755
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,283
Why don't you ever wear
black underwear?

756
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,877
- Say...
- Yes?

757
00:46:38,044 --> 00:46:39,795
Do you want to keep
looking for a long time?

758
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,465
I'm not rushing you.
Take your time.

759
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:47,095
How long...how long
do you think it will take...

760
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,180
until you have seen everything?

761
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,183
At your leisure.

762
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,353
- Oh, you know...
- I'm not rushing you at all.

763
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,023
I just wanted to know how
much longer this will take.

764
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,650
- About.
- Just a moment longer.

765
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:05,279
- What are you actually looking for?
- I don't know yet.

766
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,365
You don't know what you're looking for?

767
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:10,368
So, I have now seen
everything and now know,

768
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:13,538
that it is here, also, that i
here really wouldn't know,

769
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:16,999
- what i still have here...
- Why are you so impatient?

770
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,334
Come on!

771
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:21,462
I have in 45 minutes,
well, let's say, 2,000

772
00:47:21,629 --> 00:47:24,423
blouses, little shirts
and panties inspected.

773
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,260
That is more than in
the 59 years before.

774
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:30,680
I thought I would have to set
myself up there for the night.

775
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,350
- What is it?
- Absolutely nothing.

776
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:37,520
- Wanna drive?
- Nah, nah, you go ahead.

777
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:43,734
It was nice that we went
shopping together once.

778
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,278
Too nice.

779
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,822
Did you see him?
He came from the right!

780
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:50,950
No, I don't see anything.
I can't see anything at all!

781
00:47:51,117 --> 00:47:55,617
I'm closing my eyes, because
traffic makes me nervous.

782
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:59,125
Drive a bit slower
and stay in your lane.

783
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:02,378
I'm driving exactly 50.

784
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:06,799
See? I knew it!
No, no, no!

785
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:09,593
(Brakes squeal)

786
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:13,222
- What is it?
- You're driving!

787
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,476
Then we'll get home safe, harmoniously
and without a nervous breakdown.

788
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,062
(Multi-voiced horn honking)

789
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,857
My name is Lohse. My wife
and I are just switching places.

790
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,988
There were some disagreements
about the driving style.

791
00:48:29,155 --> 00:48:31,365
(Still honking)

792
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,160
I thought it would be
better if my husband drove.

793
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:37,371
You wouldn't have decided
differently in my place.

794
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,874
Now we can go on right away.

795
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,840
(Engine stutters and whines)

796
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:52,887
(Engine stutters and whines)

797
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,973
Here it is!

798
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,059
(Reads with exaggerated accent)
\"The Mini

799
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:01,187
Piffi 4 was manufactured
with all new gear

800
00:49:01,354 --> 00:49:04,315
and thoroughly tested
before leaving the factory.

801
00:49:04,482 --> 00:49:08,486
The Mini Piffi 4
mixes fast and easily..."

802
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:10,988
Isn't there a Japanese
explanation for this?

803
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,074
Wait...oh, I see.

804
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,617
(Laughs exaggeratedly)

805
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:17,745
Now give me that, sit in the living

806
00:49:17,912 --> 00:49:19,663
room and please don't do anything.

807
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,760
Oh, excuse me!
I didn't even see you.

808
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,680
Well...

809
00:49:37,515 --> 00:49:41,435
- Please, sit down!
- Mr. Lohse!

810
00:49:43,688 --> 00:49:47,274
Well, a little sip
now and then..."?

811
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:56,325
You're welcome.

812
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,925
Do you actually clean up at home

813
00:50:13,092 --> 00:50:15,385
yourself, or do you...

814
00:50:15,553 --> 00:50:18,681
have you got a
clean...a clean...helper?

815
00:50:18,848 --> 00:50:21,934
(Laughs embarrassedly)

816
00:50:22,101 --> 00:50:25,395
My wife unfortunately won't let me help.

817
00:50:25,563 --> 00:50:27,189
I do help her.

818
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,026
You see, and I'm not allowed to.

819
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,111
She has something against my help.

820
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,783
That's probably more of a
communication breakdown.

821
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,788
I think it has something
to do with gender.

822
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,582
That's the old
hatred between the sexes.

823
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:48,669
That's it. If I see my husband
sitting at home like that...

824
00:51:02,725 --> 00:51:05,686
(Rhythmic squeaking)

825
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,985
A certain aversion
between women and men

826
00:51:13,152 --> 00:51:15,821
- it is quite natural.
- That's right.

827
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,365
Apart from procreation.

828
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:21,285
- That's it.
- That's a different topic.

829
00:51:21,452 --> 00:51:25,456
My husband always has something
too. Men always have something.

830
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:27,374
He always has something.

831
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:30,962
Women and men are opponents,
who only agree in one point...

832
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:34,423
- One shouldn't get married at all.

833
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,759
- One should rather try to balance the opposites of the sexes.

834
00:51:36,926 --> 00:51:38,844
Men don't listen at all!

835
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,472
We should have talked to
each other much more often!

836
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:43,557
- Am I interrupting?
- No.

837
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,393
Would you please come over here?

838
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,981
They'll excuse me, I think.

839
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,863
(Mrs. Lohse) Whenever I need

840
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,781
you, you're drunk with Mrs. Kleinert!

841
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:01,492
Please let me know before you marry

842
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:03,827
her, and if you want to live here afterwards!

843
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,497
- Should be a surprise.
- This thing doesn't work.

844
00:52:06,664 --> 00:52:08,040
Why not?

845
00:52:08,207 --> 00:52:09,958
Am I the graduate engineer 
or are you?

846
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:15,339
It's a very simple
mechanism.

847
00:52:15,506 --> 00:52:19,134
(Loud bang,
clattering and rattling)

848
00:52:21,387 --> 00:52:24,473
- Hello, Mrs. Kleinert! 
- I'm making the beds now.

849
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,935
 We're supposed to let them know if we want to live

850
00:52:28,102 --> 00:52:30,437
- here after the wedding
- Goodbye.

851
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,982
That's Uli.

852
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,389
Good morning, I am
registered with Mr. Drögel.

853
00:53:05,556 --> 00:53:08,600
- With whom?
- With Mr. Drögel.

854
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:13,268
Drögel... Drögel, Drögel,
Drögel, Drögel, Drögel...

855
00:53:13,856 --> 00:53:16,608
- Don't know him.
- He is director here.

856
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,778
Ah, you mean
Mr. Director Drögel.

857
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:22,323
He is in the fabrication, straight
ahead through the sliding door.

858
00:53:30,581 --> 00:53:32,499
Hello, Heinrich, this is Renate!

859
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,586
Nonsense, Kurt...Heinrich.
Heinrich, I meant.

860
00:53:35,753 --> 00:53:38,172
Where is Kurt anyway? Is he at home?

861
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:41,050
We haven't had anything for a
long time... How are you doing?

862
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,177
You lose touch completely...

863
00:53:43,344 --> 00:53:46,305
Tell me, where...where
is Kurt anyway?

864
00:53:46,472 --> 00:53:49,266
Yes. Here is Heinrich.

865
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:53,729
Duuu... Gerti, I'm standing
here in the phone booth

866
00:53:53,896 --> 00:53:55,814
and would have liked to speak to him.

867
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:58,526
Do you think I can
quickly stop by yours...

868
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,821
Yes? Right now? Yes.

869
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,990
Well then see
you...see you later. Yes.

870
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:06,867
Hello?

871
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,801
Ah! Madam!

872
00:54:23,968 --> 00:54:27,304
That's really nice!

873
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,974
My name is Lohse.
You kindly gave me -

874
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,935
your business card.
- I know, I know.

875
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:35,479
I'm glad you're here.

876
00:54:35,646 --> 00:54:37,814
Mr. Drögel, before you
get the wrong impression...

877
00:54:37,982 --> 00:54:39,900
We have been leading
in the production and

878
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:42,486
distribution of chocolate
bars for 27 years.

879
00:54:42,653 --> 00:54:45,656
- Mr. Drögel...
- If I may still say so, I

880
00:54:45,823 --> 00:54:48,826
took over the company
from my uncle Erich

881
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:51,245
Klotz, my mother is a Klotz, and run the

882
00:54:51,412 --> 00:54:54,498
company further under
the name Riegel Klotz,

883
00:54:54,665 --> 00:54:58,752
because the block bolt has
established itself as a brand name

884
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,797
and, uhm, because the
term \"Riegel-Drögel" - or

885
00:55:01,964 --> 00:55:06,464
"Drögel-Riegel" isn't...
- Mr. Riegel, uh, Mr.

886
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,764
Drögel, I actually didn't
intend to become employed.

887
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,223
But for private reasons I don't

888
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:14,351
want to stay at home all day...

889
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,896
Ms. Lohse, I know,
what you're trying to say.

890
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,981
We offer you free collaboration as a

891
00:55:19,148 --> 00:55:21,316
counterweight
to your domestic

892
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,861
partner, to whom you probably
need some distance.

893
00:55:24,028 --> 00:55:26,405
- So that not, uh...
- Uh, yes, yes.

894
00:55:26,572 --> 00:55:29,866
But how do you know if
I'm suitable for this work?

895
00:55:30,034 --> 00:55:33,328
I feel it.

896
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,457
How am I supposed to know,
why Renate has changed?

897
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,542
What about a zeppelin?

898
00:55:38,709 --> 00:55:42,295
We write on it
"Renate, I love you".

899
00:55:42,463 --> 00:55:43,881
Renate doesn't look up.

900
00:55:44,048 --> 00:55:46,425
Or I'll get you the
chancellor for breakfast.

901
00:55:46,592 --> 00:55:49,261
- That too!
- I could arrange that.

902
00:55:49,428 --> 00:55:52,264
- No.
- Then buy yourself a new suit.

903
00:55:52,431 --> 00:55:55,434
- Women are through with such things... 
- How is Renate?

904
00:55:55,601 --> 00:55:58,145
Fine. Uh, thank you,
tha-thank you. Very...very good.

905
00:55:58,312 --> 00:56:02,733
But there must be
something, that impresses you.

906
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,861
I'm telling you, Renate
wants to admire you.

907
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:07,612
That's your whole problem.

908
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,948
Women love about us the

909
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,034
extraordinary, what they themselves don't...

910
00:56:14,328 --> 00:56:18,415
Heinrich, you smoke too
much. Kurt, I quit completely.

911
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,877
Oh, that's just the way it is.
That has nothing to do with...

912
00:56:24,505 --> 00:56:26,423
Say...you watch television.

913
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,134
If there's nothing on at the cinema.

914
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:31,929
"The Schnakenburg Family". 20
million people watch it every week.

915
00:56:32,096 --> 00:56:35,390
They're shooting the finale now.
They're still looking for a villa for that.

916
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,601
- One like yours.
- So what?

917
00:56:37,768 --> 00:56:39,811
Then Renate sees you
on TV!

918
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,730
- Me?!
- Well, your house,

919
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,151
and we'll get you in there too. I know them all.

920
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:48,404
Then you're on TV. That
will blow Renate away!

921
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:51,907
- How do you know that so exactly?
- I'm an advertising professional.

922
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:54,367
- I know what's going on!
- Oh, come on!

923
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:01,876
For me your personal opinion about our new

924
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:06,543
chocolate bar's fall offer would be very important.

925
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:08,674
My opinion?

926
00:57:08,841 --> 00:57:11,343
The opinion of a woman
of education and taste.

927
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:15,472
If you'd like to try
this offer for example.

928
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:20,140
That's a coconut filling with
pistachio foam as a carrier mass.

929
00:57:22,563 --> 00:57:24,231
(Wet Squeaking)

930
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,651
For older people we have developed

931
00:57:27,818 --> 00:57:31,238
the woodruff- soft cream variant.

932
00:57:32,865 --> 00:57:34,783
(Squeaks even louder)

933
00:57:36,535 --> 00:57:40,539
The taste particles unfold best by

934
00:57:40,706 --> 00:57:43,166
alternating sucking and chewing.

935
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:46,837
- I don't know if you're there...
- Yes, yes...

936
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,262
- Renate?
- Wrong!

937
00:57:55,429 --> 00:57:58,557
- Ah, Mrs. Mielke!
- No one opened at the front.

938
00:57:58,724 --> 00:58:02,144
I think it refers to. You
should be on time...

939
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:04,354
I'm coming in. But only briefly.

940
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:07,191
If my sister finds
out, she'll kill me.

941
00:58:11,612 --> 00:58:12,904
(Mrs. Mielke giggles foolishly)

942
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,865
(Mr. Lohse giggles
embarrassedly)

943
00:58:15,032 --> 00:58:16,324
Well...

944
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,454
- Do you have a dog?
- No.

945
00:58:23,624 --> 00:58:26,543
Renate, uh, my wife
and I, we are going to my

946
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,629
mother-in-law's 80th birthday
the day after tomorrow.

947
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:29,755
Oh?

948
00:58:29,922 --> 00:58:31,673
Yes.

949
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:39,097
In our autumn offer we have
2 Krokant compositions...

950
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,934
Are there still... I
mean, how many...

951
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,269
at the moment I don't feel very...

952
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,647
Oh! May I...

953
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:49,066
You have very beautiful hands.

954
00:58:49,233 --> 00:58:51,068
Ach?

955
00:58:51,235 --> 00:58:54,947
How are your impressions
of the collection so far?

956
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:58,659
Yes, well, with that
one, I liked it less...

957
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:02,079
I felt better about it afterwards.

958
00:59:02,246 --> 00:59:06,291
- That was Kirsch nougat...
- Yes.

959
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:10,959
But this one here, the brown one...

960
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,507
Chestnut cream...

961
00:59:13,674 --> 00:59:17,260
Yes, I'm quite...well...

962
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:19,346
I understand.

963
00:59:19,513 --> 00:59:22,599
And the double nut in a cream coat?

964
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:26,437
Also. That also.

965
00:59:28,272 --> 00:59:31,984
Are you serious with me?

966
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,427
Do you have something against...

967
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,724
Something not right?

968
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:06,560
What is supposed to be
not right?

969
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:12,441
Ah...what is supposed to be
not right?!

970
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:15,611
I'm sitting here and
drinking a... what is that?

971
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,321
Bitters.

972
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,782
Bitters and I have a job
too. Everything is fine!

973
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,956
- When will you retire?
- Excuse me?

974
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,959
When you retire.

975
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:33,212
I speak quite clearly, don't
I? Another one, please.

976
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:36,173
Sometime I'll close up shop.

977
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,592
And then we'll stay on Mallorca.

978
01:00:38,759 --> 01:00:41,219
And there you will then get
on your wife's nerves for the

979
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,390
rest of your life. Have a good
trip! When are you leaving?

980
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,600
When are we taking off? Well…

981
01:00:46,767 --> 01:00:51,267
When we don't feel
like it anymore here.

982
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:59,988
Who is that ghost
in the knitted dress?

983
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,074
That's my wife.

984
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:05,369
Charming! With very short hair.

985
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:07,829
And the fat one
with the mustache?

986
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,791
That was in Bad
Harzburg. I was pretty...

987
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:12,876
I had a mustache then.

988
01:01:13,043 --> 01:01:15,712
Are there any butter cookies
left outside? I'll take care of that.

989
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,840
They're on the table.

990
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:24,054
(The doorbell rings)

991
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:34,523
(Mr. Lohse) Ah, Mrs.
Mielke! That is very nice!

992
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:36,817
I'm not disturbing, am I?

993
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:39,027
Your wife wanted to go into town.

994
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,864
No, I'm always happy when

995
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,574
I'm alone, that someone stops by.

996
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:48,241
I'm looking for my sister. She's usually at home

997
01:01:48,495 --> 01:01:51,498
around this time and I thought that she might...

998
01:01:51,665 --> 01:01:55,085
- Ah! You have visitors?
- Yes. Uh, no, not directly.

999
01:01:55,252 --> 01:01:57,921
I just looked at the old photos

1000
01:01:58,088 --> 01:02:01,299
and then I made myself a cup of tea.

1001
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:02,634
2 cups.
Yes.

1002
01:02:02,801 --> 01:02:04,385
One was dirty. So I
quickly got a clean one.

1003
01:02:04,553 --> 01:02:07,347
And right away another glass
because the other one was also.

1004
01:02:07,514 --> 01:02:10,600
..used.
- I'll clear this up quickly.

1005
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:14,062
- Let me help you.

1006
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,107
Not yet. I'll just
leave it like that.

1007
01:02:17,274 --> 01:02:21,278
We are now going into the kitchen.
Through the hallway into the kitchen!

1008
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:24,114
At home I have to do
everything myself anyway.

1009
01:02:24,281 --> 01:02:27,242
Brigitte is no
great help for me.

1010
01:02:27,409 --> 01:02:29,411
I'm afraid I have
to tell you this.

1011
01:02:29,578 --> 01:02:34,078
She is indeed... I don't
know if you know this...

1012
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:36,584
but that stays between us,

1013
01:02:36,752 --> 01:02:39,713
my sister also has a
certain amount of damage.

1014
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:43,425
Oh? I didn't even... um...

1015
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:48,638
- May I make myself comfortable?
- Oh yes, of course.

1016
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:50,724
Brigitte is, as far as
men are concerned,

1017
01:02:50,891 --> 01:02:53,852
somewhat haphazardly,
if I may put it cautiously.

1018
01:02:54,019 --> 01:02:56,771
- Do you understand what I mean?
- Certainly.

1019
01:02:59,316 --> 01:03:01,735
You should have
actually noticed it already.

1020
01:03:01,902 --> 01:03:03,820
No, nothing. I have
absolutely nothing.

1021
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:06,031
Really. I think, I haven't
noticed anything.

1022
01:03:06,198 --> 01:03:09,993
Men are blind. What
are you doing there?

1023
01:03:12,037 --> 01:03:14,998
Mr. Lohse, you want
to steal my shoe!

1024
01:03:15,165 --> 01:03:17,083
God, how sweet!

1025
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,757
(Piercing scream)

1026
01:03:23,924 --> 01:03:26,343
Brigitte! Brigitte!!

1027
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,721
Where is this measly weasel?

1028
01:03:29,888 --> 01:03:33,391
Where has this sausage stuffed
in casing hidden itself?

1029
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,727
- Do you mean your sister...?
- Ha!

1030
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:40,023
We have visitors.

1031
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:52,953
Renate?

1032
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:59,501
(Ominous music, Police
siren in the background)

1033
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,888
(Music becomes
increasingly menacing)

1034
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:15,559
(Police siren Now very close by)

1035
01:04:42,294 --> 01:04:45,588
"I deny, the break-in at
the house Mozartstraße 4"

1036
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,674
to be involved and assure

1037
01:04:47,841 --> 01:04:50,844
I don't know the people
involved in the break-in.

1038
01:04:51,011 --> 01:04:52,929
Um... Yes.

1039
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:55,390
Oh, could I maybe
make a phone call?

1040
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:56,849
You're welcome.

1041
01:05:00,979 --> 01:05:02,897
Heinrich?

1042
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,403
(Phone rings)

1043
01:05:12,157 --> 01:05:13,533
Lohse.

1044
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,327
Here is Heinrich.
Where were you then?

1045
01:05:16,453 --> 01:05:17,912
If someone asks
questions here...

1046
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,457
- (Dog howls) 
- ... then it's me

1047
01:05:20,624 --> 01:05:23,752
Do you have an explanation
for this retiree orgy?

1048
01:05:23,919 --> 01:05:26,463
You, uh, no.
They dragged me into it.

1049
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:30,634
Yes. There lay that shoe and
I had her bag in my hand

1050
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:33,220
and then she screamed.

1051
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:36,390
The doorbell rings, Gertrud
and Brigitte Mielke enter.

1052
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:39,935
to fight in our living
room! That can...

1053
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,520
No, that's not how it was!

1054
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,730
At first, we were only two.

1055
01:05:43,897 --> 01:05:46,274
I don't know that, I
ran off, you know.

1056
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,902
Now be a dear and pick me up.

1057
01:05:49,069 --> 01:05:52,322
Excuse me? I'm here
with business partners.

1058
01:05:52,489 --> 01:05:54,157
Address?

1059
01:05:54,324 --> 01:05:55,950
Günzelstraße 6.

1060
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,035
Günzelstraße 6.

1061
01:05:57,202 --> 01:05:59,120
What? Oh, so at, uh…

1062
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,498
- What is your name?
- Meisenbach.

1063
01:06:01,665 --> 01:06:03,416
Uhm, at Consul
Meisenbach. Don't ring,

1064
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:06,587
I stand outside. And I'm not
standing directly in front of the door.

1065
01:06:12,968 --> 01:06:14,886
So please, what should we do?

1066
01:06:15,053 --> 01:06:18,598
I, uh, I'm going to forbid
all female neighbors,

1067
01:06:18,765 --> 01:06:21,726
- to visit me. 
- I am serious!

1068
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:24,563
It's raining now too and
I don't have an umbrella!

1069
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,647
Moment.

1070
01:06:25,814 --> 01:06:29,859
(Romantic Music)

1071
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:33,196
Oh, Heinrich!

1072
01:06:33,363 --> 01:06:36,991
You have something of your
own now with your candy factory.

1073
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,786
And I've also come
up with something.

1074
01:06:39,953 --> 01:06:41,871
Everything will be
completely different.

1075
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:48,920
(Din of voices)

1076
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:58,805
Kurt?

1077
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:01,016
Yes, my boy? You look good!

1078
01:07:01,141 --> 01:07:04,018
So, I am the former tutor
of the Schnakenburgs?

1079
01:07:04,144 --> 01:07:06,563
- I think so. 
- But I don't have to say anything?

1080
01:07:06,688 --> 01:07:09,691
No, you were given a miss.
You will only be carried out.

1081
01:07:09,816 --> 01:07:11,150
Also, please no word!

1082
01:07:11,276 --> 01:07:13,987
And at 5, half past 5 are
everyone outside again?

1083
01:07:14,112 --> 01:07:15,363
But yes indeed!

1084
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:18,575
It wouldn't be a surprise
for Renate otherwise.

1085
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,493
Also, Mr. Lohse assumes,

1086
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:23,663
that by 5, half past 5, 
the place is free again.

1087
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:26,500
- We're turning the 28th?
- And the 29th.

1088
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,793
Then we need Father
and Mother Schnakenburg.

1089
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:31,796
- We're tacking on the finale.
- Shall we continue?

1090
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:34,674
It was agreed upon, 1 shooting day, 
 Wrap at 5:30 PM.

1091
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,136
- Who approved this?
- Nobody tells me anything.

1092
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:41,014
We are open until 7
today and from 9 tomorrow.

1093
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:45,184
- No, no, no!
- Teach that to Mr. Lohse.

1094
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:49,022
(Din of voices)

1095
01:07:51,775 --> 01:07:54,778
Heinrich, I have great news.

1096
01:07:54,903 --> 01:07:57,822
We're going crazy and
doing the whole finale tomorrow.

1097
01:07:57,948 --> 01:07:59,908
The Schnakenburg
finale in your house.

1098
01:08:00,033 --> 01:08:04,078
And you did it!
Renate can be proud of you.

1099
01:08:04,204 --> 01:08:07,165
- Too bad, Mrs. Lohse.
- Yes, it's too bad.

1100
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:10,294
I am interested in, namely,
not just chocolate bars.

1101
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:13,213
My husband had
great difficulty tonight,

1102
01:08:13,338 --> 01:08:15,298
but we then spoke out.

1103
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,384
I understand.

1104
01:08:17,509 --> 01:08:20,178
I now know where my place is.

1105
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,930
Renate, I love you.

1106
01:08:22,055 --> 01:08:25,058
You have your bars, Mr. Drögel,

1107
01:08:25,183 --> 01:08:28,686
I need my home. My...my nest.

1108
01:08:28,812 --> 01:08:31,564
I understand.

1109
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:34,693
(Sentimental music)

1110
01:08:34,818 --> 01:08:36,778
(Music fades out)

1111
01:08:36,903 --> 01:08:39,280
(Ominous sounds)

1112
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:45,203
Heinrich!

1113
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:53,754
- You cannot go through here. 
- Where is my husband?

1114
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:57,424
- Heinrich! What happened?
- Renate!

1115
01:08:57,549 --> 01:08:59,634
My God, he should
probably lie down!

1116
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,596
- The whole surprise...
- Don't talk.

1117
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:06,057
- I am the tutor...
- That's enough, Heinrich.

1118
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:08,685
- I am here, you know.
- Oh my God!

1119
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:11,604
- Kurt!
- Hello, Renate!

1120
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:14,607
That's great! Isn't
it...? That's just... Well?

1121
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:17,318
What on earth has happened here?

1122
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:20,989
Schnak-Schnakenburg's End
in the house of Lohse.

1123
01:09:21,114 --> 01:09:24,492
On Easter on Channel One.
Your husband set all of this up.

1124
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:27,787
Everyone who has nothing to do her, 
 leaves the set now!

1125
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:30,999
- Is that a new trapdoor?
- What do you want?

1126
01:09:31,124 --> 01:09:34,710
Nothing! I'm just Mrs.
Lohse and used to live here!

1127
01:09:34,836 --> 01:09:37,296
I can't work like this. KURT!

1128
01:09:37,422 --> 01:09:41,922
You... somehow
I feel that Renate

1129
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,512
- is not particularly happy.
- But yes!

1130
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:45,805
She is not thrilled.

1131
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:48,433
Women can't show that.

1132
01:09:48,558 --> 01:09:49,559
Ah?

1133
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:53,772
(Din of voices)

1134
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,209
Heinrich, can I talk
to you for a minute?

1135
01:10:14,334 --> 01:10:16,919
- Wait a moment, wait a moment!
 - I would like now please

1136
01:10:17,045 --> 01:10:19,547
- Speak to my husband immediately!
- Certainly.

1137
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:47,075
Have you noticed that this is
the only place in our house where

1138
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,285
- What's left for us? 
 - Oh.

1139
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:52,414
Am I wrong about that?

1140
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:54,666
- What does retirement mean?
- (Flush toilet)

1141
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:57,752
Please tell me now,

1142
01:10:57,878 --> 01:11:01,882
if this is the room, where
we will live in the future!

1143
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:05,135
- Renate...
- It also has its good sides!

1144
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:07,470
We've gotten closer again!

1145
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,598
I want to know it now!

1146
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:11,808
Then I'll prepare for it!

1147
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:15,311
I'm sure I'll come up with my
own idea sometime in our house...

1148
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,230
Now listen to me carefully!

1149
01:11:17,355 --> 01:11:20,983
You're now putting this
whole bunch out there.

1150
01:11:21,109 --> 01:11:24,946
or you can live out your
retirement wherever you want!

1151
01:11:25,071 --> 01:11:27,239
But not with me!

1152
01:11:27,365 --> 01:11:30,868
And for my birthday I'm
driving alone tomorrow!

1153
01:11:30,994 --> 01:11:33,579
Who has a birthday tomorrow?

1154
01:11:33,705 --> 01:11:36,499
My mother!

1155
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,251
Shattering glass

1156
01:11:38,376 --> 01:11:40,252
Mr. Lohse is here.

1157
01:11:40,378 --> 01:11:42,046
My wife just said,

1158
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,632
You should make your
recordings elsewhere.

1159
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:46,634
- Quiet, please!
- Turn it down!

1160
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,219
- We're rolling!
- Camera rolling!

1161
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:49,512
- Rolling!.
- Cut!

1162
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,431
- 28.4, take 2.
- Action!

1163
01:11:57,145 --> 01:12:00,481
- Goodbye.
- Thank you, that's it for today.

1164
01:12:34,432 --> 01:12:37,476
Renate? Renate!

1165
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:44,943
(Sad music)

1166
01:13:18,184 --> 01:13:20,936
Man, Wutzack, just do something.

1167
01:13:21,062 --> 01:13:23,022
(Belts)

1168
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:27,193
Why can't you just
lie on your own spot

1169
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:29,279
like other dogs too?

1170
01:13:29,404 --> 01:13:30,822
(Whining)

1171
01:13:30,947 --> 01:13:32,990
- Dad?

1172
01:13:33,116 --> 01:13:35,868
This is Emiko.

1173
01:13:45,128 --> 01:13:47,547
Your father should
take the thin coat.

1174
01:13:47,672 --> 01:13:50,132
You should take the thin coat.

1175
01:13:53,136 --> 01:13:56,180
Oh, Mrs. Kleinert, you're putting
everything right again, aren't you?

1176
01:13:56,306 --> 01:13:59,726
Start from the top.
- Yes sir.

1177
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:16,576
Ask your mother,
when the train leaves.

1178
01:14:16,701 --> 01:14:20,037
- When does the train leave?
- At 9:18.

1179
01:14:20,163 --> 01:14:22,456
At 9:18.

1180
01:14:22,582 --> 01:14:25,585
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1181
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:27,420
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

1182
01:15:00,286 --> 01:15:02,371
I am your aunt.

1183
01:15:02,497 --> 01:15:05,416
Because I am
your mother's sister.

1184
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,710
Hm-hm.

1185
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:12,336
Therefore, your
grandmother is my mother.

1186
01:15:12,632 --> 01:15:17,132
And my mother-in-law and
your mother's mother.

1187
01:15:17,303 --> 01:15:19,138
Hm-hm.

1188
01:15:23,476 --> 01:15:25,978
Also your father's
mother-in-law.

1189
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:28,856
Therefore, your father
is my brother-in-law.

1190
01:15:28,982 --> 01:15:31,442
- Your brother-in-law.
- No, honey.

1191
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:36,068
- That would be Renata's brother.
- Your uncle is right.

1192
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:39,117
Hellmuth always knows
these things so well.

1193
01:15:39,242 --> 01:15:42,536
No, we complement
each other very well.

1194
01:15:42,662 --> 01:15:45,665
I always rejoice when
Hedwig knows better.

1195
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:47,750
You are such a good man.

1196
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,046
<i>Hmm! Do you know the story</i>

1197
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:54,174
about the community nurse
and the cow?

1198
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:57,218
Tell your father, we don't
want to hear this story.

1199
01:15:57,343 --> 01:15:59,136
We don't want
to hear this story.

1200
01:15:59,262 --> 01:16:01,389
Yes, yes. Perhaps...
that is perhaps also,

1201
01:16:01,514 --> 01:16:03,974
maybe that's not... Uhm, yes.

1202
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,727
Aren't you feeling well, Renate?

1203
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:09,939
- Yes, indeed. Thank you.
- I'm actually always well.

1204
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:13,735
Only when you are not
well, am I also not well.

1205
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,736
(Coughs)

1206
01:16:20,825 --> 01:16:24,578
We were not separated for
a single day in our marriage.

1207
01:16:24,704 --> 01:16:27,164
For 21 years.

1208
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:32,336
But we like to travel.

1209
01:16:32,462 --> 01:16:35,339
And how are you doing, Heinrich?

1210
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:39,552
Uhm, I'm fine, yes. 
I'm...fine.

1211
01:16:39,677 --> 01:16:42,805
- So, gentlemen. 
- I'll get the ice.

1212
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:44,682
The cake, please.

1213
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:47,685
(Mr. Lohse) For
me, that's.. )Yes.

1214
01:16:47,811 --> 01:16:49,562
For whom was the cake?

1215
01:16:49,687 --> 01:16:52,106
- We share her.
- We share everything.

1216
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:54,025
Then I can cash in right away.

1217
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:55,609
(Train screeches on the tracks)

1218
01:16:55,735 --> 01:16:57,862
This is the turn at Holzhausen.

1219
01:16:57,987 --> 01:16:59,571
I'll take care of
that right away.

1220
01:16:59,697 --> 01:17:01,657
(Dieter laughs)

1221
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:05,119
One does not mock the
misfortune of another human being.

1222
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:08,248
But if there is an
occasion for joking,

1223
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:11,167
I like to chuckle sometimes.
Your Aunt Hedwig too.

1224
01:17:11,292 --> 01:17:13,752
Real joy comes from the heart.

1225
01:17:13,878 --> 01:17:18,257
We are cheerful people
and enjoy ourselves together.

1226
01:17:20,009 --> 01:17:22,511
I am happy about
your pretty pendant.

1227
01:17:22,637 --> 01:17:24,847
Yes, Mother wore
that for a long time.

1228
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:27,850
Too bad. He makes
you look so pale.

1229
01:17:31,312 --> 01:17:35,399
(Orchestral music)

1230
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:57,588
(Girls' choir sings cheekily)
We congratulate you,

1231
01:17:57,714 --> 01:18:00,425
Mrs. Jensen is turning 80 today.

1232
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:03,344
Long live she,

1233
01:18:03,469 --> 01:18:06,263
Now and forevermore.

1234
01:18:06,389 --> 01:18:09,100
We wish you a long time

1235
01:18:09,225 --> 01:18:12,061
A cheerful heart and
contentment,

1236
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:16,687
Among your acquaintances
and many relatives.

1237
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:21,029
We congratulate,

1238
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:23,990
Mrs. Jensen turns 80 today,

1239
01:18:24,115 --> 01:18:26,867
Long live she.

1240
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:29,912
Now and forevermore!

1241
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:36,169
There are still 2 verses.

1242
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:39,588
I think, that's enough now. I
have to eat something now.

1243
01:18:39,714 --> 01:18:41,298
Stay calm and sit still!

1244
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:46,221
Madam, You are
light as a feather.

1245
01:18:46,346 --> 01:18:47,805
Are you sitting
comfortably, Mother?

1246
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:51,726
That's the 80th now. The
75th was just recently.

1247
01:18:51,851 --> 01:18:54,061
No, not with your back outwards.

1248
01:18:57,857 --> 01:19:01,485
I always say, Food keeps
body and bowl together.

1249
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:03,446
Soul! Body and soul!

1250
01:19:03,571 --> 01:19:05,531
Interesting, that
women can't conduct.

1251
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:07,659
Why can't I conduct?

1252
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:10,495
- I am Pastor Hummel.
- Never mind, never mind!

1253
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,331
Here, here, right
here in the middle.

1254
01:19:13,456 --> 01:19:15,332
Or no! To the head end!

1255
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:18,461
Mother, we carry you, 
wherever you want.

1256
01:19:18,586 --> 01:19:20,921
<i>Light... like a feather.</i>

1257
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:23,132
May we sit next to you, Mother?

1258
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:24,717
Sit where you want.

1259
01:19:24,842 --> 01:19:27,928
Dieter, for you the ladies
of the choir have set a place.

1260
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:31,724
This is my place. I always
sit next to my husband.

1261
01:19:31,849 --> 01:19:34,893
(Mimics)" "I always
sit next to my husband!

1262
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:47,282
(Grandma Jensen) Now we eat.

1263
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:49,409
otherwise I can become
very uncomfortable.

1264
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:29,073
(Giggles foolishly)

1265
01:20:35,288 --> 01:20:37,373
- Do you belong to the family?
- No.

1266
01:20:37,498 --> 01:20:38,832
Lucky pig.

1267
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:40,918
What's that?

1268
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:42,503
- Herb cream soup.
- Ugh!

1269
01:20:43,921 --> 01:20:46,089
That's herb cream with tarragon.

1270
01:20:46,215 --> 01:20:48,675
Food is for sustenance. One
does not speak about it.

1271
01:20:48,801 --> 01:20:51,386
Hellmuth and I eat
sufficiently, but simply.

1272
01:20:51,512 --> 01:20:54,264
Now the mayor is talking!
Lütje, what is it now?

1273
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:58,727
I thought, after the... after
the main course, I thought.

1274
01:20:58,853 --> 01:21:02,773
(Incomprehensible mumbling)

1275
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:09,405
(Snickered)

1276
01:21:13,534 --> 01:21:15,494
(Glass clinking)

1277
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,872
Hellmuth wants to say something.

1278
01:21:17,997 --> 01:21:19,081
My dear God.

1279
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,167
Esteemed Mrs. Mama,

1280
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:23,419
my highly esteemed
ladies and gentlemen,

1281
01:21:23,544 --> 01:21:28,044
Dear family! 80
years! 80 lived years,

1282
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:31,719
of which 47 were marriage
years, the most beautiful.

1283
01:21:31,844 --> 01:21:33,804
That's new to me.

1284
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:38,430
Anyway...so...Hedwig and I,

1285
01:21:38,893 --> 01:21:41,896
we have been in our
6-year engagement period

1286
01:21:42,021 --> 01:21:44,523
mutually exclusive

1287
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:49,028
and are now already rewarded
daily for so many years

1288
01:21:49,153 --> 01:21:52,781
through our harmonious coexistence,
for each other and...

1289
01:21:52,907 --> 01:21:56,785
Uh, yeah. Man and woman
are they... Or something like that:

1290
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:58,871
Man and woman
complement each other.

1291
01:21:58,996 --> 01:22:03,000
If I may just say this freely.

1292
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:07,626
I wouldn't be what I am
without Hedwig, and Hedwig...

1293
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:10,758
Even if we mistakenly
differ in opinion,

1294
01:22:10,883 --> 01:22:15,095
have we become particularly fond of
each other. I believe it will be clear ...

1295
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:18,307
Listen here! Hedwig!
 - ...what I'm trying to say.

1296
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:21,227
We may be proud of each other.

1297
01:22:21,352 --> 01:22:24,355
Our sympathy goes
out to all couples,

1298
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:28,609
to those this is
obviously not granted.

1299
01:22:28,734 --> 01:22:33,234
Maybe they'll finally
toast to my health. Cheers!

1300
01:22:33,406 --> 01:22:37,906
- (All) Long live she...
- It won't be sung anymore!

1301
01:22:38,619 --> 01:22:41,079
(All fall silent abruptly)

1302
01:22:41,205 --> 01:22:43,040
Now my bag has fallen down!

1303
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:45,126
I'll be screwed.

1304
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:50,965
My husband prepared
for Mother's birthday.

1305
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:53,050
You and your
husband, this milk roll,

1306
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:56,220
You are so wonderful,
that it chokes me up!

1307
01:22:56,345 --> 01:22:59,598
- No, how ordinary!
- Can I help you, darling?

1308
01:22:59,724 --> 01:23:01,600
Maybe they will reappear.

1309
01:23:01,726 --> 01:23:04,770
Mom asks when you'll
be back upstairs for dinner.

1310
01:23:04,896 --> 01:23:09,396
Renate has expressed
herself very badly about us.

1311
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:12,069
When it comes to the relationship 
between man and woman, we

1312
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:14,071
won't be trifled with.

1313
01:23:14,197 --> 01:23:16,657
And if Renate is so ill-mannered, 
she has a problem.

1314
01:23:16,782 --> 01:23:19,534
- Esteemed guests...
- We have always noticed,

1315
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:22,412
- that your marriage lacks warmth.
- Inner warmth.

1316
01:23:22,538 --> 01:23:24,498
Well! We're missing her.

1317
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:28,628
And unfortunately, we are also lacking
your deep affection for each other.

1318
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:30,880
This wonderful and yet
so humble happiness.

1319
01:23:31,005 --> 01:23:33,215
And the cheerfulness
coming from within.

1320
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:36,677
The cheerful basis for
harmonious coexistence.

1321
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:44,143
- Hedwig...listen up! Hedwig!
- Did you hear that, Mother?

1322
01:23:44,268 --> 01:23:47,896
Hedwig, the mayor
is speaking with you!

1323
01:23:48,022 --> 01:23:50,149
(Slurring) Hedwig,
you are the sharpest,

1324
01:23:50,274 --> 01:23:54,069
what I have ever encountered
between Heringsdorf and Borkum.

1325
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:57,406
Mr. Lütje, you just said
something very vulgar!

1326
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:02,032
The mayor certainly
wanted to do me a favor.

1327
01:24:02,286 --> 01:24:04,621
I am not of that opinion.

1328
01:24:04,747 --> 01:24:06,957
And we are never of
different opinion.

1329
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:09,543
Then please join my opinion.

1330
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:12,797
- Do you belong to the family?
- No.

1331
01:24:12,922 --> 01:24:15,925
I apologize for the
lewdness of my wife!

1332
01:24:17,593 --> 01:24:21,471
(Dieter) "She spoke to him, 
she sang to him,

1333
01:24:21,597 --> 01:24:23,181
And he was lost to her spell.

1334
01:24:23,307 --> 01:24:26,268
Half she pulled him,
half he sank down,

1335
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:28,979
And he was never seen again."

1336
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:30,689
And then?

1337
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:33,067
Nothing more.

1338
01:24:33,192 --> 01:24:36,778
(Everyone is talking at once)

1339
01:24:36,904 --> 01:24:38,238
Something is broken between us!

1340
01:24:38,364 --> 01:24:40,366
You have taken the innocence
from our togetherness!

1341
01:24:40,491 --> 01:24:42,826
What? I didn't
understand the last part.

1342
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:45,955
Did you actually
speak with me just now?

1343
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,373
<i>No, I was just
talking to myself.</i>

1344
01:24:48,499 --> 01:24:50,292
But now you've said something.

1345
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:53,129
- I wouldn't know what.
- You said,

1346
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:55,047
that you were
talking to yourself.

1347
01:24:55,172 --> 01:24:56,965
- Yes.
- Like I said.

1348
01:24:57,091 --> 01:25:00,302
Pastor! Say something,
for heaven's sake.

1349
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:01,804
My dear friends...

1350
01:25:01,929 --> 01:25:04,681
What a wonderful party!

1351
01:25:04,807 --> 01:25:08,185
- No one is listening anyway. 
 - ...no idea about women!

1352
01:25:08,311 --> 01:25:11,022
How do you want to know
if I can conduct or not?

1353
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:14,150
I don't care whether
you can conduct or not.

1354
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:15,985
(Laughs exaggeratedly)

1355
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:20,610
I'm missing something about
you. I don't know exactly what.

1356
01:25:22,116 --> 01:25:25,744
Hedwig, you are the
hottest, who ever...

1357
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,830
Should I serve the Pear Helene?

1358
01:25:27,955 --> 01:25:30,207
- What's that?
- Heinrich!

1359
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:32,626
This is an apple
compote with cream.

1360
01:25:32,752 --> 01:25:35,421
2 times.

1361
01:25:35,546 --> 01:25:38,382
(Conducting a march
with a chicken bone)

1362
01:25:38,507 --> 01:25:42,552
Could it be that
I... that I have been

1363
01:25:42,678 --> 01:25:45,681
- Not always quite...
- Yes.

1364
01:25:45,806 --> 01:25:48,809
If I now try even harder...

1365
01:25:48,934 --> 01:25:52,020
No, Heinrich,
please! Only not that.

1366
01:25:53,856 --> 01:25:56,900
But there must be something
provided for these cases!

1367
01:25:57,026 --> 01:25:59,361
Rules of thumb or
something like that.

1368
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:03,407
And what if we now
do something together?

1369
01:26:03,532 --> 01:26:06,284
What should we do together?

1370
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:08,495
(Mrs. Lohse) It should
be something sensible.

1371
01:26:08,621 --> 01:26:11,665
(Mr. Lohse) Meaningful!
Meaningful it must be!

1372
01:26:34,271 --> 01:26:38,771
(Extremely discordant
recorder playing)

1373
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:08,472
(Cheerful marching music
overlays the false flute)
