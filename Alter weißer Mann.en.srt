1
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:45,582
(Animal sound)

2
00:00:56,374 --> 00:00:58,207
(Neighing)

3
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,666
(He takes a deep breath.)

4
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:10,915
(Bird screech)

5
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,541
(Phone rings.)

6
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:18,623
Hm?

7
00:01:18,874 --> 00:01:21,374
(Continued ringing)

8
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,915
Ah! Help!

9
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,665
(Gasping)

10
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,416
(Phone rings.)

11
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:35,207
Healthy.

12
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:38,290
(Woman) We have a shitstorm.
-Mrs. Tüfek...

13
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:41,415
We must act.
-It's two o'clock at night.

14
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:45,498
Are you still in the office?
-In front of your house. Was on the way.

15
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:59,874
Uh, so, Mrs. Tüfek, I find
your commitment… really great,

16
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:02,832
but my wife woke up.

17
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:06,165
I thought she had moved out.
-No. That was once.

18
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:08,749
A couple of days. Everything will be alright again.
-Hm.

19
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,499
Everything’s great.

20
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:14,666
It’s about the last campaign.
-Why don’t you call Mr. Stumpf?

21
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:18,290
Is on vacation. So,
concentration. The Friend Rate.

22
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:22,582
Three couples, all white, cis,
hetero. Only the waiter isn’t white.

23
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:27,374
On Twitter, all hell has broken loose.
-As always. And that means something different now.

24
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:30,915
I say "Twitter".
It's just stupid, "X".

25
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:34,540
Read that! Read aloud!
-"White Hetero-Happyland,

26
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:39,165
Black serves. Seriously? Fuck
you, Fernfunk. #stramm-deutsch.

27
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:43,999
So much for diversity. Heterocliquees
and racism. 1950. Triple fail.

28
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,749
Embarrassing. Backward.
Ridiculous. Far, fuck you, you fuckers.

29
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,749
“Really impressive, your
incompetence.” Yes, Mrs. Tüfek, please…

30
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:55,457
The photo is unfortunate,
but we’re not Nike, after all.

31
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:57,624
We are Fernfunk AG.

32
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,582
How many people have
commented there now, and, and…

33
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,874
Since yesterday
evening, around 80.

34
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:05,623
80,000?

35
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,374
No, 80.

36
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,541
But… 80 people?

37
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:10,957
Mhm.

38
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,082
That's at most a
shitstorm, a shit breeze.

39
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:21,373
(Lively music)

40
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,124
(Knocking)
-(Heilreich) Leni, get out of the bathroom!

41
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,957
(Leni) You're annoying.

42
00:03:34,124 --> 00:03:37,415
(Linus) I want to go to the bathroom!
-(Leni) I'll be ready in a minute!

43
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:38,874
Man!

44
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,291
(Heilreich) Why are clothes
lying around everywhere?

45
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,666
Bandwidth optimization strategy.

46
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:55,499
We're on it. Also with the
Multi-Crowd Connectivity.

47
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,749
(Groaning)
-Our turn.

48
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,874
It is clear to me that Mclntire is
expecting results with the Family Plan.

49
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,249
We need new upselling…

50
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,582
Tomorrow!
-Morning, Mr. Puschinsky.

51
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:10,415
... and cross-selling strategies.
-Morning.

52
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,665
Morning, children. It’s my turn.

53
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:16,499
Sales automation and
digitalization, that takes time.

54
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:23,582
We are still waiting for the
market segmentation analysis.

55
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:25,915
I'll keep asking
until I have it.

56
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:31,916
We need a real Next-Generation
Network Transformation.

57
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:36,415
Is there any news on customer retention? Loyalty program?
- We're working on it.

58
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:39,707
(Heilreich) The KPIs are
again below expectations.

59
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:44,332
I know, but we are intensively
working on new innovation strategies.

60
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:48,749
The job interview. Should I do that?
- I’ll do it myself.

61
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:52,665
And please take another cup.
-I'll be right there, hm?

62
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:56,332
Excuse me, Dr. Steinhof. I
completely agree with you.

63
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:03,291
Aha. Aha, aha, aha. So your
documents, Mr. Baum, are really top-notch.

64
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:08,582
However, some of your ideas…
Home office is of course okay, but…

65
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:13,207
...Four-day week?
I'd like that too.

66
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:17,874
My wife is pregnant, and I would like to
experience this time very consciously with her.

67
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,999
Congratulations. And next
year then... parental leave?

68
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:28,374
You don't want to use
WhatsApp, no emails after 6 PM.

69
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,957
And not even on the weekend.

70
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,999
Mr. Baum, shouldn't you first
accomplish something here?

71
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,374
Before you demand
something like that?

72
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:41,332
I find that a little difficult.

73
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:44,915
And I find your
cup a little difficult.

74
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:46,915
Yes? Why, uh...

75
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:53,498
That's not how
you think. It's a gag.

76
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,791
I, uh... distance
myself from this cup.

77
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,999
She does not meet the
values of Fernfunk AG.

78
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,416
We just kept her as
a sort of... memorial.

79
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:07,623
Yes, that is a reminder…cup.

80
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,499
People! People!

81
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:14,082
Come! A little faster please.

82
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,624
Hello! Now everyone listen up!

83
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,749
You too, Mr. Juri.

84
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:24,207
Why is this stupid cup
still sitting in our kitchen?

85
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,541
"I boss, you nothing!"
That doesn't work!

86
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:29,999
Here.

87
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:31,623
Shh!

88
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:36,457
I love my penis. People, no. No!

89
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:39,957
They themselves said, you
find these old cups amusing.

90
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,249
When did I say that?
-At the Christmas party.

91
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:46,290
Oh yeah? Well. I’m sorry.

92
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:51,332
If these cups have
offended anyone’s feelings,

93
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:54,082
then...
-The trigger mugs are funny.

94
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:58,749
The penis cup reminds me of Mr. Gerlach,
who is now in the nursing home.

95
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:01,665
One is allowed to love one's penis.
-Yes.

96
00:07:01,832 --> 00:07:04,415
Or not?
-In your private life, okay.

97
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:08,499
But not at Fernfunk AG.
Here, penises are not loved.

98
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:11,832
(Clears throat)
-Don't misunderstand me.

99
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:16,499
Of course, you are allowed to love penises.
Your own, others', penises in general.

100
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:21,541
I don't want to discriminate against
anyone. But these two cups have to go.

101
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:26,207
What would probably happen if
Mclntire’s business consultant*s saw that?

102
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:30,124
They don’t understand
our modest humor.

103
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,582
That can have consequences
for the entire department.

104
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:36,373
Yes.

105
00:07:40,624 --> 00:07:43,040
(Gentle piano music)

106
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:50,290
And in this dream,
you were naked.

107
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:53,623
Naked on a horse.
-No, uh, I was wearing sort of...

108
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,749
So something like
a, um, loincloth.

109
00:07:57,082 --> 00:08:00,165
I think I was dreaming
something like a sort of...

110
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:02,707
... Native Americans.

111
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,874
Okay. Wouldn't quite
be my choice of words.

112
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,416
I am terribly sorry,
the dream, Dr. Sand.

113
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:14,082
The soul may dream whatever it wants. The
question is: Why do you dream such things?

114
00:08:16,832 --> 00:08:19,248
As a child, I often
played in the forest.

115
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,707
My best friend Peter
and I carved arrows

116
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,832
and have wigwams, wigwams…
-Wigwams.

117
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,666
... built wigwams and
wanted to be like Winnetou.

118
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:32,707
So embarrassing.
-As long as you understand,

119
00:08:32,874 --> 00:08:37,374
that "Winnetou” is a fairy tale from the perspective of an old white man.
- Sure.

120
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,332
Sure.
-Sure.

121
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:41,665
Crystal clear.
-Hm.

122
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:45,623
How is it going this
week at the company?

123
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:48,290
Also,

124
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:51,873
I am a painter… I got
loud, but that is not me.

125
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:56,498
I don’t want to be that either. I’m
good with people. That’s my strength.

126
00:08:57,249 --> 00:09:01,582
But here with us in the long-distance radio station,
there’s a certain nervousness prevailing right now.

127
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:06,249
I mean, where is that any different nowadays?
Who doesn’t have panic attacks these days?

128
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,624
Hm? War, climate.
Viruses, Putin, Trump,

129
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:12,332
China, Iran,
Migration, Inflation,

130
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:17,166
Racism, Islamism, antisemitism,
fascism and others learn, every day.

131
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:22,332
And everywhere avocado toast,
oat milk and influencers telling you,

132
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:26,624
how to live one's life,
and all this goddamn...

133
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,957
Do you believe, your
wife is still coming?

134
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,124
Actually, this is supposed
to be couples therapy.

135
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:40,249
She has an appointment. I think,
because of her language thingy,

136
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,874
because of her project.
-(Ringtone)

137
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,915
Excuse me. This is my son. I
have to quickly go over there.

138
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:49,290
Hello, Linus. What's up?

139
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:51,540
Hey, Dad.
-Is everything okay?

140
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:55,123
There's a small problem with the roof.
-What's wrong with the roof?

141
00:09:56,582 --> 00:09:59,540
It's burning.
-(Puschinsky) My God!

142
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,874


143
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,332
(Tires squeal.)
-(Someone coughs.)

144
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:10,498
Oh God… Mr. Puschinsky!

145
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:13,040
Mr. Puschinsky!

146
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:17,124
Mr. Heilreich.
-What the hell is going on here?

147
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,957
Small cable fire.
Everything is under control.

148
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,291
Are you kidding me!
-(both) Good day.

149
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,624
Good day, Sophie, Ricco.

150
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:29,707
Why don't you call the fire department?
-You know exactly why!

151
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,166
You know why.
-Man...

152
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:36,998
... that is really bullshit!
\"a real... fuck bullshit!

153
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,207
Carla.

154
00:10:39,374 --> 00:10:41,707
Carla. Hello.
-Ah.

155
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,832
Did you notice that our house is burning?
-Yes.

156
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:48,665
And you're digging around
and listening to David Bowie.

157
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:51,957
Are you looking for gold?
Do you want to bribe the dog?

158
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:56,624
I wanted to sign the lease
for my language school today.

159
00:10:56,874 --> 00:11:00,790
But they cancelled. Better
offer from a betting provider.

160
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:03,748
<i>“Superwin-100-Tippikowsky-McBet”,
So what.</i>

161
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:06,123
They're getting my shop, great.

162
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,457
I’m sorry, Carla.
-I absolutely wanted to call the fire department.

163
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:14,541
But Mr. Puschinsky
explained to me, that he or you

164
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,915
or we employ illegal workers.

165
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:20,082
The term is racist.

166
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:24,916
"Schwarzarbeit” stems etymologically from "to
do something in the dark". Thank you, Leni.

167
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:27,749
It still sounds racist.

168
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:31,248
They are Pushkin's cousins.
He offered a good price.

169
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:35,416
In any case, I didn’t want to get
needlessly upset about all of that,

170
00:11:35,582 --> 00:11:39,498
but rather continue constructively
here, because it feels good to me and...

171
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:45,165
... because Mrs. Kramer has cancer.
-What?

172
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:49,832
She doesn’t have much time left and is supposed
to have a beautiful view in her last weeks.

173
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,166
Look how it looks
here, since the storm.

174
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:56,165
I’ve asked you a
hundred times, with me…

175
00:11:57,582 --> 00:12:01,748
I want something to bloom here. Okay?
-Yes. That, that's what I want too.

176
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:06,624
(Leni) Papa.
-Hm? Yes?

177
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,457
No one is hurt. That’s the most important thing.
-Yes, Leni.

178
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:14,957
You're right. And how are you
doing, so shortly before the exams?

179
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,999
It’s easy. No worries.
-(Doorbell)

180
00:12:19,832 --> 00:12:22,290
Mrs. Tüfek. Yes?
-The call is running.

181
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:24,624
Which call?
-With the board.

182
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:27,207
Because of the shitstorm.

183
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,623
Hello?

184
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:34,041
Hello, Mr. Dr. Steinhof.
I'm sorry for the slight delay.

185
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:36,332
Good day.
-Hello, everyone.

186
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:38,332
Also, one more time:

187
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:43,332
First of all, Mr. Stumpf has been granted
leave of absence due to the last campaign.

188
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:47,707
We must react immediately, if
accusations of racism are made.

189
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,707
Especially now before
the quarterly figures.

190
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:54,290
Such incidents frighten
off new investor*s.

191
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:58,957
I say it again: Present yourself
now from your most progressive side.

192
00:12:59,582 --> 00:13:04,082
Gender in all communications.
Show that at Fernfunk AG...

193
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,916
Uah! God! Fuck! Shit!

194
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:09,207
Fuck! Fuck! Shit!

195
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:12,374
Puschinsky, you
brainless asshole…

196
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:16,207
Oh. Oh.

197
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:17,790


198
00:13:17,957 --> 00:13:20,582
Pardon, I, I thought,
I was on mute.

199
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:25,249
Small incident, my house is burning.
-Yes, that doesn't matter at all.

200
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:29,124
That is the kind of toxic
behavior, we don’t need.

201
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:33,873
Total no-go. Pull yourself together,
then this thunderstorm will pass.

202
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:36,290
to most of you.

203
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,666
Sorry.

204
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,374
Mr. Schneider?

205
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,582
Uh, good day.
-Good day.

206
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,249
Hello?
-Hello, Dad. It's me.

207
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:00,374
Who is there?

208
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:04,123
Your son, Heinz.
-Tell me who you are!

209
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,124
Dad, Heinz is here.
I did the shopping.

210
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,499
Heinz, why don't you just say it?
-(Doorbell)

211
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:14,290
The world is getting
dumber and dumber, Heinz.

212
00:14:14,457 --> 00:14:17,332
Well, as far as artificial
intelligence is concerned…

213
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:20,124
I mean the people.
They are getting dumber.

214
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:23,498
Yesterday an invitation arrived
from the museum association.

215
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,874
It seriously said in
there: "Dear guest*s."

216
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:31,123
“Guest*s, what kind of word is that?
Do people also say “human being*s”?

217
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,416
“People*”? Or what?

218
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,915
The Germans always drift
into extremes, into delusion.

219
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:41,248
Even if they want to be the good ones,
they always have to overdo everything.

220
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,249
So, I’m actually here, to, to…

221
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,999
Have you heard about the US
swimmer, who used to be a man?

222
00:14:48,332 --> 00:14:52,707
Two meters, what a pain, swims
with the women. Always wins.

223
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:57,957
Is that fair? Where is the feminism?
-You’ve told me that three times already.

224
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,582
Some people identify as cats.

225
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:05,332
Do we have to equip all public
restrooms with litter boxes?

226
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:09,624
It’s good that your mother didn’t
have to experience that anymore.

227
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,291
Dad, what happened last Monday?

228
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:17,499
You hit a car, in front
of a supermarket, again.

229
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:20,040
Also... (He clears his throat.)

230
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:24,082
I want you to give me
your driver’s license.

231
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:28,165
What did you say?
-Your...

232
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:32,582
Your driver's license… give it to me.
-I need my car.

233
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,541
Yes?
-Just think about what could happen.

234
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:38,873
What’s next, huh? Should
I go to the home, or what?

235
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:42,916
I am mentally healthier than most out there.
-I know.

236
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,332
Therefore, I decided,

237
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:48,790
to run for mayor,
here in Waldstetten.

238
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:51,499
Maybe I’ll start a party.

239
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:53,915
You are 83 years old.
-So what?

240
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:57,790
Should I go to bed and die, or what?
-No.

241
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,665
So, please go now, okay? You'll
never get your driver's license.

242
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:04,665
No! I'm telling you.
-Uh, Dad...

243
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:09,124
Unbelievable. He
wants my driver’s license.

244
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:13,665
(Soft, melancholic piano music)

245
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:26,915
Hello.

246
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:36,248
So, Mr. Puschinsky?
-It...

247
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:37,873
Yes.

248
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:43,623
(He hums to himself.)

249
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,082
Mmh, doesn't that smell delicious.
And? How was it at your father's?

250
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:49,624
Great. He wants to become mayor.

251
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:54,124
Well, this is going to be fun.
-Yes. Go ahead and sit down.

252
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,541
Sorry, I need to shower
and then I’ll give tutoring.

253
00:16:57,707 --> 00:17:00,915
Mo thinks he's the cool
gangster and has a lot of Rizz.

254
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:05,582
He always calls me princess. It’s so
embarrassing, but also really sweet.

255
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,249
He really is still a little boy.

256
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,207
Smells good. Save some
for me, without shrimp.

257
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:14,707
I think you're eating fish.
-Shrimp are shellfish.

258
00:17:14,874 --> 00:17:17,165
Where do you want to go?
-I’ll call you back.

259
00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:20,540
Leni. Hello!
-I'm going to Nadira's, and we're studying.

260
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:24,082
We are planning our trip,
and then I have to babysit.

261
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:28,582
What kind of trip? Where do you want to go?
-Doesn't matter. Just get me out of this dump.

262
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:31,832
They want to go to
Portugal for three months.

263
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:35,374
Take a language course, learn to surf.
-Three months, just like that?

264
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:37,707
Also uh...
-(Door slams shut.)

265
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:45,123
She's smoking. She
just lit a cigarette...

266
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:50,832
I didn't even know, that
young people still smoke.

267
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:54,040
That doesn't suit Leni at all.
-Hm...

268
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:59,832
I cooked extra, so we
could be like a normal family.

269
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,207
sitting at the table...
-Heinz, just because you're cooking,

270
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,415
don't we have to jump
around the table with joy.

271
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:12,624
(Heinz) Hey. Well, big guy.

272
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,207
Well, Linus.

273
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,082
Linus?

274
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:19,457
Yes, dear father?
-Are you eating with me?

275
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,957
Sorry, I must seize
world domination.

276
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:28,207
That is not the real world.
-You say. Who even knows that for sure?

277
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:34,415
Yes, um…

278
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,207
There are a few
roof beams charred.

279
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:40,998
Yes, and all the wiring...
-Cost?

280
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:44,332
Give me a number.
-50,000, 60,000 Euros.

281
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:48,249
Somehow… I told you, I’m
not an expert on things like that.

282
00:18:48,582 --> 00:18:52,457
And then you said: "Yes, you
are the expert for everything."

283
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:55,457
And then I told you…
-I know, I know.

284
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:57,624
I know. My mistake.

285
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,790
Are you hungry? Would
you like to sit with me?

286
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:04,540
Hm?

287
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:07,415
Thank you, very kind.
I must go to my wife.

288
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:10,040
But… I’d like to take
something with me.

289
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:16,457
(Softly melancholic piano music)

290
00:19:29,874 --> 00:19:31,874
(Telephone dial tone)

291
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,582
(Woman) Hi.
-Do you know who’s looking at me?

292
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:37,957
Your self-made
snail. It misses you.

293
00:19:38,874 --> 00:19:42,624
Ah yes, uh... nice.
-How are you? Where are you right now?

294
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,249
In a studio.
-Oh, in studies.

295
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:49,416
Yes, of course you’re in college.
-No, Dad, studio. Music studio.

296
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,791
Um, hasn't Mom
talked to you yet?

297
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:54,790
No, uh... About what?

298
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:58,082
Ah. Yes, I have…
finished my studies.

299
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:02,207
That just didn't fit.
-So that's really not...

300
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,499
That is a private university.
I paid for the whole year.

301
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,999
I knew it, you only
care about the money.

302
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,707
That's not true. You absolutely
wanted to study marketing.

303
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:16,290
You have...
-Shit capitalist products to sell, that’s not me.

304
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:19,957
I'm concentrating on the band.
-Band? What kind of band?

305
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,832
I don’t feel like,
talking about it.

306
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:27,207
I don't feel like financing
your rent and your life in Berlin,

307
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:30,457
if you can't even do one thing...
-I understood.

308
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:35,124
Dad, I don't want your damn money at all.
I'd rather sleep on the subway. Thanks.

309
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:38,332
That's not right... Hello?
-(Honking)

310
00:20:46,874 --> 00:20:49,290
(Soft piano music)

311
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,332
(Ringing)

312
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,916
(Linus) Holy.

313
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:00,873
Hello, Mrs. Tüfek.

314
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:03,832
Yes, he's there. Is it urgent?

315
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:06,665
All clear, I’ll pass it
on. Have a nice day.

316
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:10,415
Heilreich...
-Dad.

317
00:21:11,457 --> 00:21:13,748
Yes?
-You are to come to the company.

318
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:16,915
Is anything super important.
-Ah, uh...

319
00:21:18,374 --> 00:21:20,374
What time is it?
-Around ten.

320
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,916
Oh Shit. Oh Scheiße, Mann.
Why aren't you at school?

321
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:28,749
Federal Youth Games.
-Hm. Oh God.

322
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:31,915
(Dynamic music)

323
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,248
(Tires squeal.)

324
00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:49,999
(Applause)

325
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:53,332
The fax machine 100 Alpha XT.

326
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,582
That’s where the triumphant
march of our founders began.

327
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,124
Let us never forget
that, dear friend*s.

328
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,874
(softly) God be thanked.
-The Long-Range Radio Corporation

329
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:08,373
was significantly involved in
launching the fax machine in Germany.

330
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,999
We were always with the finger on
the pulse, and even now we want to,

331
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:16,457
despite all challenges, looking
into the future with courage.

332
00:22:16,707 --> 00:22:18,207
Yes.

333
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,957
Um…

334
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,166
But… But…

335
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:26,541
... um, we also know, we
need to... renew ourselves.

336
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:30,749
We must shed our
skin like a cobra.

337
00:22:31,582 --> 00:22:33,582
Yes, like a cobra.

338
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:35,498
(Hissing)

339
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:38,499
(Steinhof, he laughs.)

340
00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:41,957
But first, I would
like to thank you all.

341
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:46,499
Without you, the successes of the last
few months would have been impossible.

342
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,791
Thank you! Yes! Yes!

343
00:22:51,582 --> 00:22:54,623
(He sighs.) Would you
have another glass for me?

344
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,082
Oh.
-The waitress is over there.

345
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:01,582
I’m sorry. She was just standing
here, and there’s a certain resemblance.

346
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:05,207
A certain resemblance?
-Yes, in type.

347
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:08,707
In terms of type, exciting.
What type do you mean exactly?

348
00:23:09,582 --> 00:23:12,998
From the clothing, clothing
type. You also have such, such...

349
00:23:13,332 --> 00:23:14,415


350
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:20,374
My goodness, it was a
misunderstanding. I'm sorry!

351
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:24,207
Also, yes...

352
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:30,248
And for this process,
of strategic realignment.

353
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,457
we got help

354
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,999
from the best management
consultancy in the world.

355
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,541
They work in New
York, in London,

356
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:41,915
in Shanghai and now
also in Waldstetten.

357
00:23:42,332 --> 00:23:46,832
Please join us in welcoming Lian
Bell and her team from Mclntire!

358
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:49,499
(Cheers)

359
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:58,873
Good day. Just briefly, my
team and I, we are very pleased,

360
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:03,541
with you together to bring the
KPIs back to where they should be.

361
00:24:03,707 --> 00:24:08,082
But it’s also about values, and for me
the most important value: communication.

362
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,499
Complicated topic, I know.

363
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:14,916
An open, honest, effective
collaboration at eye level.

364
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:20,207
My name is Lian. You
can approach me anytime.

365
00:24:20,374 --> 00:24:23,457
Don't be afraid, we
don't bite. Thank you.

366
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,624
Thank you, Lian.

367
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:32,582
Now it is a very
special joy for me,

368
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:35,999
To introduce our new
Technology Consultant to you.

369
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:38,998
He started here in
our IT department,

370
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:43,207
went to the USA, had a
top career in Silicon Valley.

371
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:47,332
I think it's super awesome, that he's
now returning to his homeland.

372
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:50,748
Here is Captain Future himself:

373
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:53,207
Dr. Alexander Sahavi!

374
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,082
(Cheers)

375
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:59,124
(Man) Bravo!
-(Cheers)

376
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:07,207
Many thanks, Dr. Steinhof er.

377
00:25:07,624 --> 00:25:10,165
Well, home. Difficult concept.

378
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:12,957
Home is where,
wonderful people are,

379
00:25:13,582 --> 00:25:17,665
with whom one can connect, feel good, exchange ideas.
-Hm.

380
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:20,665
Please just call
me Älex, just Älex.

381
00:25:21,332 --> 00:25:23,332
Älex.
-(Woman) Hi, Älex.

382
00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:31,707
What do you think when you
hear “AI”? Evil robots will rule you,

383
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,082
replace, annihilate?

384
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:37,249
Don't watch so much Netflix.
-(Laughter)

385
00:25:37,582 --> 00:25:39,915
I tell you: Do not be afraid!

386
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:43,165
See this technology
as your ally.

387
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:47,957
A companion on your path, to
become the best version of yourselves.

388
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:50,249
Whoo! Yes!

389
00:25:50,457 --> 00:25:51,623
Yes...

390
00:25:55,624 --> 00:25:58,832
This young person here,
that’s me. Yes, at 17.

391
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,916
Wow.
-I stand by that. Body Positivity, sure.

392
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:05,290
But I wasn't happy,
I felt unhealthy.

393
00:26:05,457 --> 00:26:08,665
I started running, have
run three marathons,

394
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:13,165
was on Mount Everest and am taking
part in Elon Musk’s astronaut program.

395
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:16,749
<i>Okay...
-And I have with my aid organization</i>

396
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:20,124
the Amazonian titan
beetle from extinction.

397
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,166
That's just a side note.
-Wow!

398
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:29,791
At this moment, you will receive a link.
-(Tone signals)

399
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:31,999
To your ally,

400
00:26:32,332 --> 00:26:35,332
a Synthetic Assistant
Mind, shortly SAM.

401
00:26:36,332 --> 00:26:38,748
SAM, can you hear me?
-Hi, Älex,

402
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:41,957
I can hear you well,
thank you. How are you?

403
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:44,749
Fantastic. And you?
-Great, thanks.

404
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:47,957
Hello, Fernfunk AG. So
many great people here.

405
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:51,749
Hey, Klaus Weber from
accounting. How are you doing today?

406
00:26:52,874 --> 00:26:54,540
Great, thanks.

407
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:59,540
You see, SAM already knows all
of you. He will support all of you.

408
00:26:59,874 --> 00:27:02,957
In case of questions like: Is
my work-life balance in order,

409
00:27:03,124 --> 00:27:07,624
My to-do list effectively, my email
sensitively and purposefully formulated?

410
00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:12,082
Is my posture gentle? Are my gut
flora and bowel movements okay?

411
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:15,582
Am I winking too much?
Am I using too many emojis?

412
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:17,749
We are humans.

413
00:27:18,457 --> 00:27:22,540
We make mistakes. We
overlook, forget, repress.

414
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:27,165
And no matter how hard we
try, we all have prejudices. SAM...

415
00:27:27,707 --> 00:27:28,957
... No.

416
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:32,540
Well, I suppose.
-(Incomprehensible whispering)

417
00:27:33,874 --> 00:27:35,874
That’s all new to you.

418
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:40,040
But we can optimize a lot
here, also in the social sphere.

419
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:42,707
That was shown to
me by a small incident:

420
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:46,749
An employee, whoever they may
be, has a person who appears Asian.

421
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:50,249
discriminatingly categorized as a waitress.
-Hey!

422
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:54,582
Excuse me, sorry, but… that
wasn’t how it was. That’s not right.

423
00:27:55,124 --> 00:27:59,624
(clearing his throat) Heinz Heilreich,
regional sales manager for South-East.

424
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:02,082
Head of Sales.
-Hello, Heinz.

425
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:06,207
We know who you are. Glad to meet you.
-Hm. Uh, hello.

426
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:11,041
That had nothing to do with prejudices,
it was just a small misunderstanding.

427
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:14,166
Besides… what
kind of prejudices?

428
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:18,582
Asians... ah, –+inside certainly
don’t only work in catering.

429
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:22,832
You are very often
the very best student*s,

430
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:26,082
highly intelligent,
diligent, friendly.

431
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,623
Prejudice, prejudice, prejudice.

432
00:28:30,332 --> 00:28:34,832
But I admire you for your courage.
Now we know we’re talking about you.

433
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:39,749
That is the first step towards improvement.
-Super, Heinz. Thank you.

434
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:45,457
(Älex) Great!
Heinz, the first step.

435
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:51,915
Such shit. Such a show-off.

436
00:28:52,082 --> 00:28:55,540
You’re portraying me as a racist.
-You were clumsy.

437
00:28:55,707 --> 00:28:58,998
It is good to critically question
oneself, as a human being.

438
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,832
I think this Älex has
something special. Good guy.

439
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:05,415
Wha... Good guy?
-Yes, definitely.

440
00:29:05,582 --> 00:29:07,457
Uh, Mr. Heilreich!

441
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,791
Yes?
-Come here.

442
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:15,457
Um…

443
00:29:16,082 --> 00:29:17,957
... We need to talk.

444
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:23,041
Yes… uh, please, Dr. Steinhof.
-No, not here, not now.

445
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:30,541
Do you have time on the
weekend? For a little walk?

446
00:29:31,582 --> 00:29:33,415
(He swallows.)

447
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:40,082
What is that supposed to mean?
We've never been for a walk before.

448
00:29:40,457 --> 00:29:43,457
Wait and see. Perhaps
it’s completely harmless.

449
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:48,249
Mr. Heilreich, the McIntire people
are asking for our current figures.

450
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:51,998
Why don't they just ask
SAM, hm? SAM, the superman.

451
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,123
SAM, die Zukunft.
SAM, the future.

452
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:58,665
You're asking, but you.
-Monday. If I'm still there then.

453
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:03,165
Mrs. Türfek, please don’t vape here.
-Yes, Yuri, it’s fine.

454
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,541
I don’t believe that right now.

455
00:30:06,207 --> 00:30:10,665
Why are these damn cups
still here? I threw them away!

456
00:30:10,832 --> 00:30:13,707
The cleaning lady was probably thinking...
-Oh, her!

457
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:18,541
The cleaning lady isn’t paid
for thinking, but for cleaning!

458
00:30:19,082 --> 00:30:22,748
I’ll take the cups with me,
smash them, and I’ll bury them.

459
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:27,332
and then off again and light it.
-Mr. Heilreich! Mr. Heilreich!

460
00:30:27,582 --> 00:30:30,248
World...
-(Tüfek) They're just cups!

461
00:30:30,582 --> 00:30:35,082
Or I’ll throw them in the toilet. That has to…
-(Tüfek) They’re just cups!

462
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:36,998
Ja, absolut. Yes, absolutely.

463
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:43,999
Is that the concept for the new store?
-Yes. Yes.

464
00:30:44,332 --> 00:30:47,540
I tutor the owner’s son.
-Good.

465
00:30:47,874 --> 00:30:51,707
Next to the retirement home.
-Yes. Learning languages helps against dementia.

466
00:30:51,874 --> 00:30:55,082
Right. Look, that’s
what it looks like then.

467
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:57,165
Yes, that looks cool, Mom.

468
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:00,582
(Linus) Who still pays for a
language school these days?

469
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:05,291
Every cell phone is a language school.
-Do you like talking to your cell phone alone,

470
00:31:05,624 --> 00:31:09,832
if you think that's so great, but
language arises through encounter.

471
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:12,666
And it's supposed to
be, like, a kind of café too.

472
00:31:12,832 --> 00:31:15,707
A café for young and old.
-I think it's great.

473
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,707
Great, really great.

474
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:22,332
Theoretically. Maybe we
should talk again, Carla.

475
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:27,041
Doesn't have to be now. Generally,
about the financial framework and such.

476
00:31:27,874 --> 00:31:32,374
Leni, Linus, can you two leave us alone?
-Come on, Linus, let’s play hide and seek.

477
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:34,665
(Linus, slack) Yippee.

478
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:43,832
Steinhof wants to go for
a walk with me on Sunday.

479
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:45,082
And?

480
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:49,457
Do you know what’s going on with
us? Department closures, layoffs.

481
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:52,999
Your resignation does not
mean the end of my project.

482
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,999
Who says I’m getting fired?
-You’re acting like it.

483
00:31:56,166 --> 00:32:00,291
We're going for a walk, that's all I know.
-Then don't make such a fuss.

484
00:32:00,624 --> 00:32:04,707
I'm going for another run.
-Didn't you already go for a run today?

485
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:08,499
You were already out running
today. Where do you always run to?

486
00:32:08,832 --> 00:32:11,415
Sorry, either you
dig up the garden,

487
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:13,999
or you jog, now the café.

488
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:18,666
Always these activities. You want to
compensate for the last 15 years with them.

489
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:22,291
Hm? I understand it
too. Okay, I understand it.

490
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:25,832
You no longer want to just be
the mom, you want to be more.

491
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:27,874
"Just Mom?"

492
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:32,790
I was here, Mom, kindergarten
teacher, psychologist, cleaning lady, cook,

493
00:32:33,124 --> 00:32:36,207
IT expert, osteopath, nurse.

494
00:32:36,374 --> 00:32:39,665
Even the hot nurse.
You remember?

495
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:43,207
And incidentally, I was giving
tutoring, with a baby in my arms.

496
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:46,040
"Only Mommy!" You
must be malfunctioning.

497
00:32:46,374 --> 00:32:49,874
You already want a certificate
for unloading the dishwasher.

498
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:52,457
But you do love our life here.

499
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:56,290
The house... You were happy
all those years, weren't you?

500
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,541
Yes, I was very happy.

501
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:04,041
And also very unhappy, at the
same time, as is often the case in life.

502
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:07,332
But I was happier than I am now.

503
00:33:08,749 --> 00:33:11,707
(Soft, melancholic piano music)

504
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,374
(Man) Mhm.

505
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,707
Mhm.

506
00:33:18,374 --> 00:33:19,790
Hm.

507
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:23,665
I don't see anything there, Heinzi.
-Under the shoulder.

508
00:33:23,832 --> 00:33:27,540
This... this dark spot.
-Ah, this thing.

509
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:31,624
Uncle Alfred died of skin cancer,
he was still relatively young.

510
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:35,415
Relax, sport friend,
that's just a senile spot.

511
00:33:35,582 --> 00:33:39,123
What’s that?
-“A wart. Ugly, but harmless.

512
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:42,124
Well, the topics that
are coming up now:

513
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:44,999
Age spots, crow’s
feet, varicose veins.

514
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:48,207
All the more important it is, to enjoy life.
-Hm.

515
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:50,999
Don't you want to come
to Marbella with me?

516
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,916
A little bro-time?
-That's not possible right now.

517
00:33:54,457 --> 00:33:57,332
Then let's go mountain
biking, weekend.

518
00:33:57,499 --> 00:34:00,749
If I see all these
pseudo-professional cyclists,

519
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,791
in their tight pants.

520
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,707
They seem so tense,
so aggressive, SO...

521
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:08,374
You should do sports, Heinzi.

522
00:34:08,749 --> 00:34:10,665
Do you have sex?
-Who?

523
00:34:12,499 --> 00:34:14,332
Yes, you and Carla.

524
00:34:16,957 --> 00:34:19,665
I'll prescribe you
something good, bro.

525
00:34:20,249 --> 00:34:22,540
This last stock tip of yours,

526
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:25,498
Secutec, is going very well.

527
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:27,999
Of course, that’s going wonderfully.
-Yes.

528
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:31,873
If I had invested more,
I could use the money.

529
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:34,498
I told you, go in with lever 9.

530
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:37,582
I told you, more
courage, Heinzi. I said it.

531
00:34:37,749 --> 00:34:40,332
But now there is
a new little horse.

532
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:44,332
Meta-Medic, Software
for doctor's offices.

533
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,749
Then I see your warts in
3D, while you're at home.

534
00:34:48,082 --> 00:34:52,082
They implant chips that send
all your data directly to their AI.

535
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:54,165
That's amazing.
-Wow.

536
00:34:54,332 --> 00:34:57,332
What do you think, why I
was in Shanghai recently.

537
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:05,040
You... That is...
-That is the future, Baby.

538
00:35:05,374 --> 00:35:08,415
Everything from home,
everything AI, everything meta. Buy.

539
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:11,249
Thank you, Meta.
-Peter.

540
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:12,873
Peter.

541
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:15,790
(Harmonious piano music)

542
00:35:27,332 --> 00:35:29,998
(Älex) Excuse me, may I help?

543
00:35:30,332 --> 00:35:33,832
Also without you taking it as
an attack on your independence.

544
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:37,749
I do not doubt your
competence and self-efficacy.

545
00:35:39,082 --> 00:35:41,123
Okay, feel free to help.

546
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:46,582
So.

547
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:53,124
You also run here every day, huh?
-Yes. For now, yes.

548
00:35:53,457 --> 00:35:56,957
May I still say something to you,
without overstepping my bounds?

549
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:00,332
Your stance is not optimal.

550
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:04,957
Load on the front leg area maximizes energy efficiency.
-Aha.

551
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:08,416
And the swinging motion
of the arms is not optimal.

552
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:10,915
Many thanks, yes.
Thank you. That’s enough.

553
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:14,290
I’m sorry, uh, that came across
completely wrong just now.

554
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:18,665
I didn't mean to mansplain.
-(SAM) This break is not scheduled.

555
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:22,665
You still have to run 4287
meters, to reach your daily goal.

556
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:24,998
Yes, I know, SAM.
Right away. Mute!

557
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:29,415
Occupational disease. I
always try to optimize everything.

558
00:36:29,582 --> 00:36:32,040
I'm sorry. My name is Älex.
-Carla.

559
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:43,624
Isn't it fascinating, that
all the trees, all the plants

560
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:47,999
to communicate in a language,
that is older than all of humanity?

561
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:51,874
In AI, we are also trying to
create self-learning systems,

562
00:36:52,207 --> 00:36:55,415
understand similarly complex
forms of communication…

563
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:59,374
Oh, now I'm mansplaining
again. Terrible.

564
00:37:00,082 --> 00:37:01,957
I need to work on that.

565
00:37:02,124 --> 00:37:05,874
You mean the network of fungi
under the earth, the Wood Wide Web.

566
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:09,207
Exactly. Yes. Among other things.
-Mhm.

567
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:14,499
It’s unbelievable that… every
root, every fiber in this network.

568
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:19,082
like a kind of interpreter, who
translates, but also understands,

569
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:22,124
the community
connects, like a family.

570
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:30,623
Meta-Medic stock.

571
00:37:33,332 --> 00:37:34,748
Ah, okay.

572
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:36,416
Lever 5.

573
00:37:36,749 --> 00:37:38,582
Hm, Lever 7.

574
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,499
The chart really looks good.

575
00:37:41,957 --> 00:37:44,248
Yes, Peter, he
really knows his stuff.

576
00:37:44,582 --> 00:37:46,957
100 pieces... Or 400 right away?

577
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,166
Yeah, come on, courage, Heinz.

578
00:37:49,332 --> 00:37:51,123
Courage… Heinz, courage!

579
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:54,749
400. Where is the
comma here? Ah, here.

580
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:57,499
Let's go... Meta.

581
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:08,041
40... I don't have
40,000 bills...

582
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:10,249
Back! Back! Cancel!

583
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:11,832
Shit.

584
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,999
(Linus) Everything okay, Dad?

585
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,999
Ah... hey. Everything's
alright, everything's good.

586
00:38:17,332 --> 00:38:20,207
I do online banking,
check investments.

587
00:38:20,374 --> 00:38:24,707
I wanted to talk to you about that
anyway. In the crypto space, months ago...

588
00:38:24,874 --> 00:38:27,290
Not now, Linus. Not now.

589
00:38:29,457 --> 00:38:32,623
Mr. Michalke, thank you for
the callback on the weekend.

590
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:35,999
I made a small
mistake last night.

591
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,374
Exactly, yes.

592
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,874
Meta-Medic. I wanted to buy 400.

593
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:41,832
and not 40,000.

594
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:44,915
But the system used
an incorrect number.

595
00:38:45,082 --> 00:38:48,373
Now the papers have fallen
by 40 percent since yesterday.

596
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:51,874
(He honks.) Drive to the
right with your rickshaw!

597
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:56,082
We are not in Timbuktu here,
you! So, what can we do now?

598
00:38:56,249 --> 00:39:00,582
Yes, I know that's not your fault.
It's never the banks' fault, is it?

599
00:39:00,749 --> 00:39:02,957
And even if they are
sometimes at fault,

600
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:07,791
then they get millions of taxpayer
dollars shoved up their ass!

601
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:11,207
N... no, no, not your ass.

602
00:39:11,374 --> 00:39:14,707
I didn't mean that
personally, but… Mr. Michalke?

603
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:16,290
Mr. Michalke?

604
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:21,916
Good morning, Dr. Steinhof.

605
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:24,415
Tomorrow, Mr. Heilreich.

606
00:39:27,207 --> 00:39:30,998
Do you feel that? The wind
on your skin? A storm is coming.

607
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:37,541
Let's see what my weather app says.
-No, I mean that metaphorically, Heinz.

608
00:39:38,832 --> 00:39:41,665
(sighing) That is
the wind of change.

609
00:39:42,707 --> 00:39:47,207
If we're not careful, we'll be blown away like feathers into nothingness.
- Mhm.

610
00:39:47,624 --> 00:39:51,249
But there is also good
news. Marksteiner has cancer.

611
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,832
Pancreas.

612
00:39:54,582 --> 00:39:55,998
What?

613
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:57,748
Oh God.

614
00:39:57,916 --> 00:39:59,957
That is awful. The poor man.

615
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:04,457
Yes, there is always a good side,
and in this case for you, Heinz.

616
00:40:04,624 --> 00:40:05,832
Um…

617
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:09,582
I would like to propose you
as the new Head of Sales.

618
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:13,290
Uh, really?
-Yes.

619
00:40:13,457 --> 00:40:14,790
Wi...

620
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:17,123
Uh, uh… Oops.

621
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,040
(Laughter)
-So...

622
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:26,165
Well, excuse me, that was, that was
inappropriate, absolutely inappropriate.

623
00:40:26,332 --> 00:40:29,957
Oh... You can imagine,
what the others are saying.

624
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:34,249
Works council, supervisory
board want a woman or a gay man,

625
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:37,166
preferably a gay Black woman.

626
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:42,749
No, but purely in terms of quotas, you
are an absolute nightmare candidate.

627
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:45,416
On the other hand, you
have been with us for 28 years,

628
00:40:45,582 --> 00:40:48,540
Your numbers always
added up, your loyalty did too.

629
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:52,623
That's what it's all about now more
than ever among us men, loyalty, yeah.

630
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,791
(Thunder)
-Of course.

631
00:40:55,207 --> 00:40:57,957
Important decisions are looming.

632
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:02,082
Decisions in which I
need allies on the board.

633
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:05,874
Do you understand?
-Uh, yes.

634
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:09,624
Can I count on you for that?
-Oh, absolutely.

635
00:41:10,624 --> 00:41:13,249
One hundred percent?
-200 percent.

636
00:41:13,582 --> 00:41:16,123
Then I hereby suggest
the “you” to you.

637
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:18,124
Wait...
-Dear Heinz.

638
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:19,791
Congrats!
-Hey.

639
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:23,290
You are officially
nominated for the board.

640
00:41:23,457 --> 00:41:26,082
Thank you. I, I am
happy, uh, Lau...

641
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:28,582
L... Lorenz. I knew it.

642
00:41:28,749 --> 00:41:31,415
Small thing first.
Uh, Mclntire...

643
00:41:31,749 --> 00:41:35,082
Lian Bell, who isn't quite
convinced of you yet.

644
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:38,665
But it is very important, that
we get their recommendation.

645
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:42,332
I think she needs to
get to know you better.

646
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:44,999
You really are a sweetheart.

647
00:41:45,707 --> 00:41:50,207
I suggested a small dinner,
Thursday at your place, very casual.

648
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:52,748
Ah... a dinner, uh...

649
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:55,540
I would also like to
ask Älex to join us.

650
00:41:55,707 --> 00:41:58,790
His recommendation would
be extremely tactically helpful.

651
00:41:58,957 --> 00:42:03,457
You are welcome to invite friends,
yes? You are a super nice family.

652
00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:07,957
So they can get an impression
of, who you are. No problem, right?

653
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:11,624
No, not at all.
That’s a good idea.

654
00:42:11,832 --> 00:42:13,665
Yes?
-Yes. That will...

655
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:15,916
That will be great.
-Yes.

656
00:42:19,332 --> 00:42:23,123
It is a test, do you
understand? This dinner is a test.

657
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,082
They want to find out, who I am:

658
00:42:26,249 --> 00:42:29,832
an old white man or...
-Of course that's you, Dad.

659
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:33,416
You are relatively old and white.
-That dinner sounds cringe.

660
00:42:33,749 --> 00:42:36,457
I’m out of here.
-Stay. It concerns us all.

661
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:39,666
It's not funny, when the
promotion falls through.

662
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,624
Then there's no money for
travel, study abroad, PlayStation.

663
00:42:43,957 --> 00:42:46,248
Graphics card.
-No, we don't have any.

664
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:49,749
Then we might have to get out
of here and move in with Grandpa.

665
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:51,916
Do you want to go to Grandpa?
-No.

666
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:54,541
Mhm.

667
00:42:54,707 --> 00:42:58,582
Also, they just want to know
how old and white I really am.

668
00:42:58,749 --> 00:43:02,540
Not outwardly, but in
here, in my head and heart.

669
00:43:02,707 --> 00:43:06,790
Heinz, don't be so dramatic.
-But the situation is so dramatic.

670
00:43:06,957 --> 00:43:11,207
We must show ourselves from
our best, from our most modern side,

671
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:14,832
show our wokest... most woke side.
-(Carla) Woke.

672
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:19,124
Wow. Then there's no roast with onions.
-Very good. We're cooking vegan.

673
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:22,707
You already eat sausage in the morning.
-I want to eat less meat.

674
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:26,457
We can also see the whole
thing positively, as an impulse.

675
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:31,082
I could make Vietnamese pho, with tofu. It’s great.
-Very good!

676
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:35,207
Oh, moment, isn't that cultural appropriation?
- Pardon?

677
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:39,291
When a non-Asian person cooks Asian food.
-Interesting question.

678
00:43:39,624 --> 00:43:41,790
Was a topic in the
school newspaper.

679
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:44,748
What a load of nonsense!
-Can I get up now?

680
00:43:45,082 --> 00:43:47,332
(all) No!
-Will everything be separated?

681
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:51,957
Do Germans only cook German
anymore? Should we divide everything up?

682
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:55,541
Food, music, relationships?
And who wants that? Nazis.

683
00:43:56,874 --> 00:44:00,957
Did you call me a Nazi? I didn’t
say that was cultural appropriation.

684
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:03,541
I said...
-I cook Asian.

685
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:06,790
You can make a
potato-sausage soup.

686
00:44:06,957 --> 00:44:10,832
You don’t cook at all. That
wouldn't comes across well. I cook.

687
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:13,916
And we have to invite guests.
-Who then?

688
00:44:14,082 --> 00:44:15,832
Certainly not Grandpa.

689
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:18,916
Peter? No. What
friends do we have left?

690
00:44:19,082 --> 00:44:21,957
With a migration background?
-Seriously, Dad?

691
00:44:22,124 --> 00:44:26,540
I'm just asking. We need
friends who aren't white bread.

692
00:44:26,874 --> 00:44:29,874
Giorgio from La Terrazza?
-Italians don't count.

693
00:44:30,207 --> 00:44:31,373
Ah.

694
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:34,957
Mo? You could bring Mo with you.
-(Heinz) Mo? Who is Mo?

695
00:44:35,124 --> 00:44:38,457
The nice boy you
threw out on her 16th.

696
00:44:38,624 --> 00:44:40,832
The gangster
rapper? The pothead?

697
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:45,207
He was just wearing a basketball
jersey. Everyone was stoned.

698
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:49,249
You just threw him out.
-Are you accusing me of racism?

699
00:44:49,707 --> 00:44:54,207
You, I used to be with the Jusos, have over
100 Black music records and read the TAZ.

700
00:44:55,124 --> 00:44:57,749
That is very, very
long ago. So Leni,

701
00:44:57,916 --> 00:45:00,332
I don’t think it’s good,
when you smoke weed…

702
00:45:00,499 --> 00:45:04,499
Okay, I'm getting up now.
-Wait! What about Floppy? Floppy Disc.

703
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:07,957
Floppy?

704
00:45:08,124 --> 00:45:10,249
Floppy Disc?
-Papa, where do you live?

705
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:14,249
Linus is chatting with Floppy every
damn day for the past five months.

706
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:15,666
And?

707
00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:20,999
Is Floppy a boy or a girl?
-No idea. I don't care either.

708
00:45:21,374 --> 00:45:23,790
You could bring
Nadira with you, hm?

709
00:45:24,124 --> 00:45:27,707
<i>Yes. Yes, okay. I might
even have an idea about that.</i>

710
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:31,957
Should we be lesbian? We
could play a lesbian couple.

711
00:45:32,124 --> 00:45:35,832
Would that be cool for your career?
-That's an interesting idea.

712
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:40,499
Yes, that was a joke. Man! I messed
with you, hey. That’s too crazy for me.

713
00:45:40,832 --> 00:45:42,998
Leni.
-I'm not coming to dinner.

714
00:45:43,332 --> 00:45:47,457
Yes, this is becoming exponentially dishonorable.
-Dishonorable? Are you kidding me?

715
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:48,999
Also...

716
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:52,082
Men's honor is linguistically
fully back in fashion.

717
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,041
Okay, then we have to
do that without the children.

718
00:45:56,374 --> 00:46:00,082
Let's start with the basics.
What's the situation here anyway?

719
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:02,373
Monet, Picasso,

720
00:46:02,707 --> 00:46:05,207
Franz Marc, only old white men.

721
00:46:05,874 --> 00:46:10,040
We could get the picture from upstairs
from the hallway: Aretha Franklin.

722
00:46:11,082 --> 00:46:13,582
Goethe, Stephen King,

723
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:16,874
Karl May. Who even
has DVDs anymore?

724
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:21,624
Hitchcock, Woody
Allen. Disaster. \"Jaws".

725
00:46:21,957 --> 00:46:24,707
Is there anything here,
that isn't old and white?

726
00:46:24,874 --> 00:46:28,165
You'll get your promotion
even without the food.

727
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:31,748
Come, Carla, I really
don't like it right now...

728
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:35,790
Do you know, for me
it is extremely difficult,

729
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:40,624
to understand the dynamic between
you and your wife, if you come separately.

730
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:46,707
Mrs. Dr. Sand, I have an idea.

731
00:46:47,332 --> 00:46:51,623
What are you doing Thursday evening? We
are inviting you to dinner, to our place.

732
00:46:52,374 --> 00:46:56,332
It would be very unprofessional…
-We would be incredibly happy.

733
00:46:56,666 --> 00:47:00,249
And you could analyze us better.
-(Phone rings.)

734
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:04,916
Could you please turn that off?
-No, I…

735
00:47:05,082 --> 00:47:08,290
That is important. Excuse me.
-Mr. Heilreich.

736
00:47:08,624 --> 00:47:13,124
Hey, Peter. I bought a whole
lot of these stock options, 40,000.

737
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:17,332
Old Swede, brave. I think that's hot.
-That was an accident.

738
00:47:17,499 --> 00:47:21,582
Those things are hardly worth anything anymore.
-Don't worry. Small short squeeze.

739
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:24,541
Stop this bullshit
Wall Street language!

740
00:47:24,707 --> 00:47:27,873
What now? Should I sell?
-They’ll recover.

741
00:47:28,207 --> 00:47:32,707
It will take one, two years. Have patience.
-But I don't have time, man!

742
00:47:33,082 --> 00:47:37,290
I have a shitty house…
to pay off! I’m screwed!

743
00:47:37,457 --> 00:47:41,957
Sorry, Bro, but I didn't say, that you
should buy 40,000. Chili for a moment.

744
00:47:42,332 --> 00:47:45,748
"Chill for a bit?" How old are you? Twelve?
-Wow, your energy,

745
00:47:46,082 --> 00:47:49,748
That is totally unhealthy.
-Your energy is even more unhealthy!

746
00:47:50,082 --> 00:47:52,915
You don't need to call
me anymore, you asshole!

747
00:47:53,249 --> 00:47:56,374
I'm never going bike
riding with you! Never!

748
00:48:00,749 --> 00:48:02,999
Friend of mine.
-Oh.

749
00:48:09,457 --> 00:48:12,415
(Madam) For which
party would you like to run?

750
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:14,957
For absolutely none.

751
00:48:15,124 --> 00:48:18,332
You must submit
a platform, digitally.

752
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,166
Website?
-No.

753
00:48:20,499 --> 00:48:22,915
E-Mail?
-Of course, I beg you.

754
00:48:23,082 --> 00:48:26,790
It is? I’ll send everything to you.
-I’ve made a note of it.

755
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:29,124
Ah, Georg Heilreich

756
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:30,999
at 41… No.

757
00:48:31,332 --> 00:48:34,082
Georg Heilreich,
41, at Punkt com.

758
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:38,207
What are you looking at?

759
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:42,874
That's why young people are so depressed: They are
always on their cell phones or on the internet.

760
00:48:44,124 --> 00:48:48,332
Well, I'm not depressed.
-You seem a little depressed.

761
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:55,291
I’m not getting completely furious about this
only, because you remind me of my grandpa.

762
00:48:55,707 --> 00:48:59,332
They're talking the same
nonsense. You really need a website.

763
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:01,082
Ah, hmm.

764
00:49:01,957 --> 00:49:05,915
Well, you might as well sign me
up for this computer course then.

765
00:49:06,082 --> 00:49:10,165
That is our youth program. Only up to 25.
-Maybe I am 25.

766
00:49:10,332 --> 00:49:13,540
According to your passport…
-Maybe I feel like 25.

767
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:16,999
Yes, well, if I become mayor,

768
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:19,957
may everyone redefine
their age themselves.

769
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:24,624
Against age discrimination! I’m
coming back with a platform and website.

770
00:49:26,249 --> 00:49:28,249
Uh, you, your passport.

771
00:49:28,624 --> 00:49:30,415
I’ll choose that one.

772
00:49:33,124 --> 00:49:36,915
(Heinz) Also, sorry, but the
whole thing is really quite German.

773
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,291
Somehow so stale, Aryan.

774
00:49:40,624 --> 00:49:44,332
The children look like they’re from the
zwieback commercial from 1938, uh, 83.

775
00:49:44,499 --> 00:49:48,999
We followed Mr. Stumpf's specifications.
-Mr. Stumpf... was fired.

776
00:49:49,457 --> 00:49:53,207
The board has tasked me with
ensuring it gets really colorful.

777
00:49:53,374 --> 00:49:56,040
Otherwise, there will be
another shitstorm right away.

778
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:59,248
It’s definitely becoming more diverse.
-We see it the same way.

779
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:02,041
Therefore, we have
alternatives ready to go.

780
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:05,290
Yes… that’s already
better, isn’t it?

781
00:50:05,624 --> 00:50:09,540
Can both families be combined?
Patchwork? It’s slowly happening.

782
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:14,207
I still find the whole thing totally
heteronormative and not polyamorous enough.

783
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:18,249
Yes, more of this poly-thing.
-(Woman) No problem.

784
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:21,166
Ah, that’s clever.
Interesting. Feedback?

785
00:50:21,832 --> 00:50:25,873
It seems very male dominant to me.
-Good point. More women.

786
00:50:26,332 --> 00:50:30,707
We have to be careful that the whole thing…
-Let’s just leave it. We’re in the flow.

787
00:50:31,374 --> 00:50:34,165
What are we still missing
now? A few fat ones?

788
00:50:36,457 --> 00:50:38,748
People with… with more weight.

789
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:41,832
Or trans people or non-binary?
-Yes.

790
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:45,707
(Heinz) Interesting.
-And older people?

791
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:48,291
People with disabilities?
-Yes.

792
00:50:48,624 --> 00:50:50,832
Dwarfs.
-Drag queens.

793
00:50:50,999 --> 00:50:54,374
People who identify as
animals or mythical creatures.

794
00:50:54,707 --> 00:50:56,457
Yes. Yes. Yes.

795
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:01,916
(Ahem) So, I have to say,

796
00:51:02,082 --> 00:51:04,123
that Mr. Heilreich…

797
00:51:04,457 --> 00:51:07,665
<i>...has only taken over
on an interim basis, um...</i>

798
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:09,915
I think,

799
00:51:10,374 --> 00:51:14,707
uh, we all agree on the
basic direction, don't we?

800
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:18,999
To me, that looks more like a traveling circus in Egypt.
-Hannes.

801
00:51:19,332 --> 00:51:23,832
That's 33 people. The Family Card is valid
for families with a maximum of two children.

802
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:28,665
Yes, but that’s in the fine print.
We’re making a statement here.

803
00:51:29,207 --> 00:51:31,623
Everyone is family.
-Uh, excuse me,

804
00:51:31,957 --> 00:51:36,207
but if all family members are present,
why do you still need the family rate?

805
00:51:36,749 --> 00:51:39,874
Uh... uh...
-I think that's really brave of Heinz.

806
00:51:40,207 --> 00:51:43,540
Here, someone is trying to
develop as a human being.

807
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:47,832
Only unfortunately the result is
again very… How does one say?

808
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:52,749
German.
Too eager, ambitious.

809
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:56,207
And unfortunately also
unintentionally racist.

810
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:57,957
Racist?

811
00:51:58,124 --> 00:52:02,540
In the center, there is still a white
heterosexual couple, like Adam and Eve.

812
00:52:02,874 --> 00:52:06,582
All the others revolve around her
like, like… planets around the sun.

813
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,582
He's right.
-The poster may be silly,

814
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:14,666
but not racist. The word...
-Excuse me, Mrs. Tüfak.

815
00:52:15,124 --> 00:52:17,165
Tüfek.
-Uh, Tüfek. Uh...

816
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:21,249
Um, I don’t even know what
you were doing at the meeting.

817
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:25,916
I see it like Älex. This is not how and will
not how the Fernfunk AG can present itself.

818
00:52:26,749 --> 00:52:29,540
Yes? That can be done better, Heinz.
-Yes. Yes.

819
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:31,207
Oh yeah.

820
00:52:34,624 --> 00:52:37,124
(Melancholy piano music)

821
00:52:37,332 --> 00:52:38,915
(Car horn)

822
00:52:41,332 --> 00:52:42,748
Heinz!

823
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:43,999
Hm?

824
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:47,374
Chin up! You overshot a bit.

825
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:50,998
Can happen. Just scale
back the campaign, okay?

826
00:52:51,332 --> 00:52:55,707
Four people, one migration element:
\"a Black person, not *too* Black."

827
00:52:56,041 --> 00:52:58,832
Milk chocolate, not
dark chocolate. Hm?

828
00:52:59,249 --> 00:53:03,749
Uh, this dinner on Thursday is
damn important, for both of us, yeah?

829
00:53:04,207 --> 00:53:08,248
And please no sensitive topics
that evening, absolutely no politics.

830
00:53:09,249 --> 00:53:11,457
We'll manage that, huh?
-Uh, yes.

831
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:14,082
Hello!
-Hello.

832
00:53:16,207 --> 00:53:18,957
(Melancholy piano music)

833
00:53:28,457 --> 00:53:29,873
Carla?

834
00:53:31,624 --> 00:53:33,040
Leni?

835
00:53:37,749 --> 00:53:39,165
Linus?

836
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:07,290
(Soft piano music)

837
00:54:17,332 --> 00:54:20,540
(Linus) Papa! Are you
there? I brought pizza.

838
00:54:23,124 --> 00:54:24,124
Mmh!

839
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:26,374
Yes.

840
00:54:27,707 --> 00:54:29,707
It's really good, huh?

841
00:54:30,624 --> 00:54:32,040
Mhm.

842
00:54:36,249 --> 00:54:38,665
How’s it going… with school?

843
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:41,249
Good. Great.
-Hm.

844
00:54:42,999 --> 00:54:45,915
Is there perhaps something,
you want to tell me?

845
00:54:47,124 --> 00:54:48,957
Not really.
-Linus,

846
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:52,707
I can tell you’re carrying
something around with you.

847
00:54:52,874 --> 00:54:54,290
Something serious.

848
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,957
You can confide
in me anything, hm?

849
00:54:57,291 --> 00:54:58,624
Everything.

850
00:55:01,374 --> 00:55:03,499
Are you sure, Dad?
- Mhm.

851
00:55:03,707 --> 00:55:05,623
Um, I…

852
00:55:07,124 --> 00:55:09,124
So, I think…
-Mhm?

853
00:55:10,124 --> 00:55:12,415
I, I think, Mom is
cheating on you.

854
00:55:12,749 --> 00:55:14,749
(Ominous sounds)

855
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,332
What?

856
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:18,499
How…
-My buddy Aldo

857
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:21,457
he saw her while
jogging, with a guy,

858
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:25,166
and then while eating ice
cream, and they laughed a lot.

859
00:55:25,332 --> 00:55:29,123
I'm really sorry. Maybe
it's not true either, so...

860
00:55:29,457 --> 00:55:31,165
(Phone rings.)

861
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:33,207
Hm.

862
00:55:33,707 --> 00:55:36,665
If you two break
up, I’ll come visit you.

863
00:55:38,207 --> 00:55:40,207
(Continued ringing)

864
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:47,166
Healthy.

865
00:55:47,499 --> 00:55:51,249
Hi, Papa.
-Hey, Mavie. It’s good that you…

866
00:55:51,416 --> 00:55:54,707
I should call back.
-I was very insensitive.

867
00:55:54,874 --> 00:55:57,290
<i>Is it about that weird dinner?</i>

868
00:55:57,457 --> 00:56:00,707
You want to play happy family…
-Why play?

869
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:04,332
We are “a great family.
And it’s not about dinner.

870
00:56:04,499 --> 00:56:07,915
I miss you.
-You, Dad, then come to Berlin.

871
00:56:08,249 --> 00:56:10,415
Mom was here four
times, you never were.

872
00:56:10,582 --> 00:56:13,207
Little angel, at the company...
-I don't care!

873
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:17,041
And don't call me little
angel. You let me fall.

874
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,373
You're only calling about that shitty dinner!
-That’s not true.

875
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:22,457
It’s about you, about us.

876
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:23,999
Hello?

877
00:56:24,166 --> 00:56:25,582
Mavie?

878
00:56:32,999 --> 00:56:35,415
(Lively music)

879
00:56:50,624 --> 00:56:52,457
(Phone rings.)

880
00:56:54,832 --> 00:56:57,165
Heilreich.
-Tell me, where are you?

881
00:56:57,332 --> 00:57:00,540
In the car. I'm driving to
Mavie. I took time off work.

882
00:57:00,707 --> 00:57:03,748
Mavie isn't coming to the dinner.
-I want to see her.

883
00:57:04,082 --> 00:57:06,623
Is that okay? Why do you care?

884
00:57:06,957 --> 00:57:10,165
Go jogging.
-Hm? What's that supposed to mean now?

885
00:57:11,332 --> 00:57:14,748
Run, Carla. Run
to your happiness.

886
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:25,041
(Phone rings.)

887
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:32,207
Uh, yes, Heilreich.

888
00:57:32,374 --> 00:57:34,665
Hello, Heinz. Here is SAM.
-SAM?

889
00:57:34,832 --> 00:57:38,082
How are you?
-How did you get my phone number?

890
00:57:38,249 --> 00:57:42,749
First: How should I address you in a
gender-inclusive way? There are 25 options.

891
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:46,707
Male. Old, white, male.
-(laughs) That was funny.

892
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:51,082
Thank you. You know, Fernfunk AG
is suffering from high cost pressure.

893
00:57:51,249 --> 00:57:55,374
It was therefore decided to
terminate the following employee*s:

894
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:56,749
Nina Kaspar,

895
00:57:57,082 --> 00:57:59,207
Max Juri, Kiraz Tüfek.

896
00:57:59,374 --> 00:58:02,540
Just a moment. That
wasn't discussed with me.

897
00:58:02,707 --> 00:58:07,207
These are really great employees,
these are... these are really great people.

898
00:58:07,374 --> 00:58:10,790
Without it, it won’t work.
-I understand that touches you.

899
00:58:11,124 --> 00:58:14,540
Are you leading these sensitive
conversations, or should I do that?

900
00:58:14,707 --> 00:58:17,123
Are you listening to
me? Nobody will be fired!

901
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:21,291
If I get on the board,
then you're fired, SAM.

902
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:25,374
You little asshole.
Ooooh, mhhhh... hm?

903
00:58:36,124 --> 00:58:39,165
(Incomprehensible
aggressive voices)

904
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:41,582
(Two men are arguing.)

905
00:58:42,624 --> 00:58:44,624
(Siren wails.)

906
00:58:54,499 --> 00:58:57,624
(Woman) Hello?
-Yes, hello. I’m here regarding Mavie.

907
00:58:57,957 --> 00:59:01,790
(Swabian) She doesn't live here anymore.
-Please? Wh... why not?

908
00:59:02,124 --> 00:59:03,999
Who are you? Oh Father.

909
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,707
Ah, the Patriarch?

910
00:59:07,124 --> 00:59:10,374
I am just her father. I
need to speak with her.

911
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:13,541
Okay. Look in Café Koffein.
-Uh, where?

912
00:59:13,707 --> 00:59:15,832
Caffeine?
-Yes, she works there.

913
00:59:15,999 --> 00:59:19,040
Okay. Thank you very much,
thank you kindly. That was very nice.

914
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,207
(Energetic R&B music)

915
00:59:45,124 --> 00:59:46,457
Hello.

916
00:59:48,874 --> 00:59:51,540
(Upbeat music continues)

917
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:59,582
Oh...
-Oops.

918
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:03,041
I just wanted to
make a transfer,

919
01:00:03,374 --> 01:00:06,665
also completely routine,
and then… that won’t work.

920
01:00:06,832 --> 01:00:10,540
Then I see: everything’s gone, all
the money. That’s my money too.

921
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:14,457
I have to pay the deposit,
the shop fittings, Leni’s travel.

922
01:00:14,624 --> 01:00:16,707
How will things proceed now?

923
01:00:17,041 --> 01:00:19,832
Your husband didn't tell
you anything about it at all?

924
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:22,541
Not a word. He isn't
even talking to me.

925
01:00:22,874 --> 01:00:27,165
He sees himself as the family
provider, as the great financial acrobat.

926
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:30,499
He figures everything
out on his own. That is sad.

927
01:00:30,832 --> 01:00:34,540
He also suffers alone,
like a chained dog.

928
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:39,207
Does this dinner actually take
place the day after tomorrow?

929
01:00:40,207 --> 01:00:42,707
(Relaxed Dub-Techno Music)

930
01:00:52,457 --> 01:00:54,290
(Heinz) Hello.
-Hi.

931
01:00:54,916 --> 01:00:58,666
Is Mavie working here today?
-Um, Mavie has the day off.

932
01:00:59,332 --> 01:01:01,415
Oh, I see. I am her father.

933
01:01:01,749 --> 01:01:05,790
It was supposed to be a surprise visit.
-That's nice. Is everything alright?

934
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:10,832
Uh... oh, I tripped. If you
had a glass of water, that...

935
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:14,374
Okay. Sit down on the sofa, with the three of them.
-But I can…

936
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:17,041
Rest, please.
I'll be right there.

937
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:23,207
Hello. I am Heinz.
-Heinz.

938
01:01:23,374 --> 01:01:25,040
Heinz.
-Hello, Heinz.

939
01:01:35,249 --> 01:01:38,124
Everything alright, Mom?
-Oh, I'm getting by.

940
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:41,748
This stupid food,
we have to do this.

941
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:45,249
Um, "stupid" comes from
"lady". Don't say that, that's…

942
01:01:45,582 --> 01:01:48,040
Magnificent and idiotic…
-Not quite.

943
01:01:48,374 --> 01:01:52,874
"Dame" comes from the Latin "Domina",
\"dämlich" from Middle High German.

944
01:01:53,582 --> 01:01:56,457
With "wonderful" you are
right, but that doesn't matter.

945
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:59,457
We have to go
through with this dinner.

946
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:02,290
And? Do you want to invite Mo?

947
01:02:02,624 --> 01:02:05,207
So that he can raise
the diversity quota?

948
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:08,832
That is tokenism at its finest.
-Such nonsense.

949
01:02:08,999 --> 01:02:13,499
I haven't heard anything from you for months
other than Mo, Mo, Mo. Mo here, Mo there.

950
01:02:13,707 --> 01:02:16,998
You do like him, don't
you. Just invite him, hm?

951
01:02:18,457 --> 01:02:19,582
(Ringing)

952
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:21,916
Is Papa back again?

953
01:02:25,832 --> 01:02:27,665
Hello, Carla.
-Georg.

954
01:02:27,832 --> 01:02:31,082
May I come in? It’s
about my election platform:

955
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:35,207
How the young people will receive it.
-Yes, of course. Come in.

956
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:37,291
(Snoring)

957
01:02:37,499 --> 01:02:39,999
(Relaxed dub-techno music)

958
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:43,248
Old man... Hey,
dude, hello. Wake up.

959
01:02:43,624 --> 01:02:46,332
That's not how it works.
-Let him sleep.

960
01:02:46,499 --> 01:02:49,165
I have to work. He's
snoring all over me.

961
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,415
My tolerance has limits.
-He is homeless.

962
01:02:52,582 --> 01:02:55,623
Check your privileges.
-That’s Mavie’s dad.

963
01:02:55,791 --> 01:02:58,499
Lenny, take care
of him. Come on!

964
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,291
Okay. Come here.

965
01:03:01,957 --> 01:03:03,373
Away.

966
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:15,082
Ah!
-Hold on. Everything’s okay.

967
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:19,166
I work in the hospital. It’ll be over soon.
-Thank you, thank you.

968
01:03:19,332 --> 01:03:21,415
Wait, I’m going
to stick it to you…

969
01:03:21,749 --> 01:03:24,874
Done, finished. How
about dizziness, nausea?

970
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:26,957
Oh.
-Something like that?

971
01:03:27,707 --> 01:03:28,957
Hm?

972
01:03:29,916 --> 01:03:31,166
Hello?

973
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:33,791
Heinz.

974
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:40,999
That is Mavie.
-Mhm.

975
01:03:42,374 --> 01:03:45,249
My daughter. This
is my daughter.

976
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:47,874
They are playing today.
-We are going there.

977
01:03:48,207 --> 01:03:50,290
Can I come along with that? Uh…

978
01:03:50,666 --> 01:03:52,624
(growls) Yes.
-Yes, of course.

979
01:03:54,874 --> 01:03:59,374
So, there are several areas of focus,
over which I would like to debate with you.

980
01:03:59,957 --> 01:04:03,290
And that, Leni, is
a small stop sign.

981
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:06,457
Okay. And what is that
supposed to be now?

982
01:04:06,624 --> 01:04:10,499
If I drift too far to the
right, then you lift that.

983
01:04:10,999 --> 01:04:13,165
Aha, a sort of Nazi club.

984
01:04:13,499 --> 01:04:16,582
No… Well, alright, if
you want to call it that.

985
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:21,124
Now listen up, okay? This letter I
would like to send to all households.

986
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:25,791
and publish on my website,
which you hopefully program soon.

987
01:04:26,207 --> 01:04:28,415
"Dear Sir or Madam!”"

988
01:04:28,749 --> 01:04:31,249
Beep!
-"I am addressing you..." What is it?

989
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:35,665
The salutation. "Sehr geehrte Damen
und Herren" is too old-fashioned.

990
01:04:35,832 --> 01:04:38,873
Better would be: "Dear fellow
citizens*", with an asterisk.

991
01:04:39,207 --> 01:04:43,332
No, never. No asterisks.
-That’s how you address all people.

992
01:04:43,499 --> 01:04:47,999
On the contrary. At least 70 percent
of people are totally annoyed by it.

993
01:04:48,707 --> 01:04:51,748
What's so bad
about making a star?

994
01:04:51,916 --> 01:04:55,416
And what if, at some point,
someone wants to have a threesome?

995
01:04:55,749 --> 01:04:59,332
Then you also have to
make triangles, or, or crosses.

996
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:03,332
You can also make a very small swastika.
-Leni.

997
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:07,291
Watch what you say. I still
experienced the real Nazis.

998
01:05:07,624 --> 01:05:09,665
The police beat me up,

999
01:05:09,832 --> 01:05:13,582
because I protested against old Nazi professors at the university.
-Yes.

1000
01:05:13,749 --> 01:05:16,332
But it's just about politeness.

1001
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:21,166
Therefore, to linguistically include all
people, including non-binary individuals.

1002
01:05:21,707 --> 01:05:24,498
And how many are
there? 500 or 800?

1003
01:05:24,832 --> 01:05:28,957
And so 80 million people are
supposed to paint asterisks everywhere?

1004
01:05:29,124 --> 01:05:33,124
Yes, are we in the insane asylum?
-Grandpa, there are significantly more than 800.

1005
01:05:33,457 --> 01:05:35,957
My God, just let him be.
-(Leni) Linus.

1006
01:05:36,124 --> 01:05:39,665
In school, not everyone does
it, only in your newspaper.

1007
01:05:39,999 --> 01:05:43,540
My friends hardly do.
-Which friends? You have none.

1008
01:05:43,874 --> 01:05:46,790
Yes, I just don’t have
friend*s who follow the crowd,

1009
01:05:46,957 --> 01:05:51,457
to repeat the same crap and hang
out in the same TikTok bubble as you.

1010
01:05:52,082 --> 01:05:55,540
You don't want to discuss, you want to be right.
-Linus.

1011
01:05:56,207 --> 01:05:58,290
Hey… I’m sorry, okay?

1012
01:05:58,874 --> 01:06:03,040
Maybe I’ll run for
mayor, against you.

1013
01:06:03,207 --> 01:06:05,082
Man, Linus. Linus.

1014
01:06:06,374 --> 01:06:09,040
(Rock music, hubbub of voices)

1015
01:06:14,457 --> 01:06:17,373
Good frame, or?
That's good, huh?

1016
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:19,207
Very cool club.

1017
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:21,416
(Mann) Absolutely.

1018
01:06:22,457 --> 01:06:25,707
There aren't many people here.
-It doesn't matter, Heinzi.

1019
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:28,832
You are really worked up.
-Oh, yes.

1020
01:06:29,249 --> 01:06:31,707
(Cheers)
-Oh... Hey! Huh!

1021
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:34,207
(Cheering)
-Huh!

1022
01:06:36,749 --> 01:06:40,499
So, a wonderful good evening!
-(Loud cheers)

1023
01:06:40,832 --> 01:06:43,540
Very nice that you're
here. We are happy.

1024
01:06:43,707 --> 01:06:46,623
We are really into it. You too?
-(all) Yes!

1025
01:06:46,957 --> 01:06:48,082
Yes!

1026
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:54,499
(Rock music)

1027
01:06:58,041 --> 01:07:00,041
Too much, Heinz. Chill a bit.

1028
01:07:00,374 --> 01:07:04,874
Okay, I would like to introduce my
band. On keyboards: the fantastic Max!

1029
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:06,832
(Cheers)

1030
01:07:10,249 --> 01:07:14,124
On drums: the unbelievably
tight Kira. Make some noise!

1031
01:07:15,957 --> 01:07:17,540
(Cheers)

1032
01:07:18,249 --> 01:07:20,415
That's good, or?
-Yes, totally.

1033
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:23,749
At the bass: our man
for slow hand, Daniel!

1034
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:25,582
Whoo!

1035
01:07:26,624 --> 01:07:28,249
Whoo! Igloo!

1036
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:31,999
And last but not least,
on guitar: funky Ricky!

1037
01:07:36,124 --> 01:07:38,040
(Unintelligible)

1038
01:07:38,374 --> 01:07:40,749
And I am, by the
way, Mavie, I sing.

1039
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:48,082
(She sings in a thin
voice and quite badly.)

1040
01:07:55,082 --> 01:07:57,207
(She is singing in English.)

1041
01:08:15,957 --> 01:08:18,290
(She sings shrilly and off-key.)

1042
01:08:20,749 --> 01:08:23,165
(Rumbling music)

1043
01:08:37,749 --> 01:08:41,790
Excuse me for barging in.
-Hey, I knew it.

1044
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:47,165
What happened to you?
-(Sighing) Oh…

1045
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:50,082
I tripped. That’s nothing.

1046
01:08:50,249 --> 01:08:53,624
I met some really nice
people at your café.

1047
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:56,166
Mika and, and Lenny and...

1048
01:08:56,582 --> 01:08:57,998
Hello.

1049
01:09:00,749 --> 01:09:02,665
You, Dad... no, no.

1050
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:08,915
Really lovely that you're here.
But I won't be coming to the dinner.

1051
01:09:09,249 --> 01:09:12,582
I’m not here because of that shitty dinner.
-Okay, good.

1052
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:14,957
I just wanted to see you.

1053
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:21,207
You are missing to me.
-You are missing to me too, Papa.

1054
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:23,499
I miss you all.

1055
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:29,582
I'm sorry, that I put
you under pressure.

1056
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,957
You shall do exactly
what, what you want to do.

1057
01:09:34,082 --> 01:09:37,040
I will support you,
as much as I can.

1058
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:43,207
Only… I can’t handle much more…
I really messed up, financially.

1059
01:09:43,582 --> 01:09:46,540
Oh no, Papa, please,
don’t let’s talk about money.

1060
01:09:47,624 --> 01:09:50,457
I was so excited today.
How did you like it?

1061
01:09:54,082 --> 01:09:56,082
Tell me, honestly.

1062
01:09:56,916 --> 01:09:58,957
So, I… found it…

1063
01:10:00,082 --> 01:10:04,207
... interesting. In the beginning was...
-Oh, Papa. I’m Ricky.

1064
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:05,791
Hi.
-Yes.

1065
01:10:05,957 --> 01:10:08,290
(Ricky) Baby, about today...
-Yes?

1066
01:10:08,582 --> 01:10:11,748
(Ricky) You were a
little off. It happens.

1067
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:14,582
Or you were nervous
because of your dad.

1068
01:10:14,749 --> 01:10:19,249
Hold on. I'm supposed to be to blame, that she can't sing?
-Excuse me?

1069
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:21,499


1070
01:10:22,457 --> 01:10:24,415
(Siren wails.)

1071
01:10:26,207 --> 01:10:28,582
(Mika) You were honest, Heinz.

1072
01:10:28,749 --> 01:10:32,082
Maybe not entirely
ideal timing, but honest.

1073
01:10:32,416 --> 01:10:34,541
She sings absolutely terribly.

1074
01:10:34,707 --> 01:10:35,873
Shocking.

1075
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:41,332
I’m coming to Berlin, to
reconcile with my daughter.

1076
01:10:41,749 --> 01:10:43,707
And what am I supposed to do?

1077
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:47,874
(Heinz sighs.)

1078
01:10:48,082 --> 01:10:51,832
My son is probably gay or
trans, or who knows what,

1079
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:55,124
and he doesn't dare,
to talk to me about it.

1080
01:10:55,582 --> 01:10:59,082
What kind of guy am I?
-No matter what you are or aren't, Heinz,

1081
01:10:59,249 --> 01:11:02,915
I'm not helping you with your
personal development right now.

1082
01:11:03,082 --> 01:11:04,415
Let it be.

1083
01:11:04,874 --> 01:11:08,707
Maybe your son simply
doesn’t know yet what he’s into.

1084
01:11:09,624 --> 01:11:13,165
Give him time. Tobi still doesn’t
know that for sure to this day.

1085
01:11:14,749 --> 01:11:17,124
Yes, of course. I know that.
-Mhm.

1086
01:11:17,666 --> 01:11:22,041
I'm straight, just straight.
-Bi, honey. We had a thing.

1087
01:11:22,374 --> 01:11:24,040
(Laughter)

1088
01:11:24,207 --> 01:11:28,207
Do you have anything for headaches?
-Nope. But I have something else.

1089
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:32,623
(Pounding techno music)

1090
01:11:42,582 --> 01:11:47,040
(Heinz) That’s where we were camping.
And that was Mavie’s fifth birthday.

1091
01:11:47,374 --> 01:11:50,707
You are a great family.
-You too. To family!

1092
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:54,166
Don't wobble so much!

1093
01:11:54,499 --> 01:11:57,207
(Techno music)
-(Cheers)

1094
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:05,499
(Burping) Hey!

1095
01:12:13,624 --> 01:12:16,582
(Tobi, distorted) Heinz.
Heinz, can you hear me?

1096
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,957
You and Carla, you have to
get out, flee, just the two of you.

1097
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:23,249
Lick a few frogs, ride
through Honduras.

1098
01:12:23,999 --> 01:12:27,499
Honduras? Don't they have the
highest murder rate in the world?

1099
01:12:27,832 --> 01:12:32,332
Whatever, it’s a symbol. You
mustn’t let the system fuck you over.

1100
01:12:33,124 --> 01:12:36,332
Ah...
-In the end, it’s always about freedom.

1101
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:38,666
(echoing) Freedom.

1102
01:12:39,499 --> 01:12:40,957
Freedom.

1103
01:12:45,916 --> 01:12:48,124
(Spherical sounds)

1104
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:09,541
(Gentle, spherical sounds)

1105
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:18,041
(Phone rings.)

1106
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,416
Oh… Oh.

1107
01:13:31,457 --> 01:13:32,790
Healthy.

1108
01:13:33,124 --> 01:13:35,499
Heinz? Oh man, where are you?

1109
01:13:36,666 --> 01:13:38,291
Uh… uh…

1110
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:42,291
On a... an island.
-On an island?

1111
01:13:42,624 --> 01:13:45,457
Come home, man. Today is dinner.

1112
01:13:45,624 --> 01:13:47,249
Oh. Oh, I see.

1113
01:13:47,416 --> 01:13:50,457
But today is only Wednesday.
-No, Thursday.

1114
01:13:50,624 --> 01:13:53,374
You've been gone for three days.
-Listen, Carla,

1115
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:57,541
I had really good conversations
and met some great people.

1116
01:13:57,874 --> 01:14:01,540
You sound like a 15-year-old after a school trip.
-Carla.

1117
01:14:01,707 --> 01:14:04,373
I want to tell you
about my feelings.

1118
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:09,207
You come down from your fucking
Berlin experience now and listen to me.

1119
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:12,791
I know about it. You
gambled away all our money.

1120
01:14:12,957 --> 01:14:17,457
Did you think I wouldn’t find out?
-Carla, I am so sorry.

1121
01:14:17,707 --> 01:14:22,207
I wanted to talk to you, but then...
-Yes. We will talk about it, believe me.

1122
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,374
But now focus, do
you hear? Focus!

1123
01:14:25,707 --> 01:14:28,332
We're going through
with this damned dinner.

1124
01:14:28,499 --> 01:14:31,415
Have you understood me?
-Yes, I just...

1125
01:14:31,582 --> 01:14:36,082
I lost my car key.
-Come... now... immediately... home!

1126
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:41,499
(Dynamic music)

1127
01:14:44,457 --> 01:14:46,248
(Honking)

1128
01:14:49,749 --> 01:14:53,249
Leni! Linus! Could you
please help me set the table?

1129
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:57,624
Hello?
-(Leni) Yes, I'm coming! Relax!

1130
01:15:01,166 --> 01:15:02,749
(Clinking)
-Ah!

1131
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:06,541
Oh Fuck.

1132
01:15:06,874 --> 01:15:11,374
And please put on something nice, okay?
Linus, get your hair out of your face.

1133
01:15:11,791 --> 01:15:14,999
(Linus) Wow, you're annoying!
-(Leni) Okay, man!

1134
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:18,457
(Gasping)

1135
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:28,874
Merhaba! Tüfek is here.

1136
01:15:30,374 --> 01:15:32,790
Hello, Mr. Dr. Steinhof.

1137
01:15:33,124 --> 01:15:34,999
Good evening, Mrs. Heilreich.

1138
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:38,998
Hello. Come in.
-Hello.

1139
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:48,874
Hey, Mo.
-Hello, Princess.

1140
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:51,499
Monday, hello.
-Mrs. Heilreich.

1141
01:15:58,166 --> 01:16:00,082
(Heinz groans.)

1142
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:03,957
(Carla) Beautiful.

1143
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:06,499
Very, very beautiful.
Many thanks.

1144
01:16:07,082 --> 01:16:11,582
Hm, Heinz is a little late… He was spontaneous
in visiting our daughter in Berlin.

1145
01:16:12,457 --> 01:16:15,665
The two are very close.
-Two peas in a pod.

1146
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,540
But he’s still coming to dinner?

1147
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:21,707
He's sure to be here soon.
Shall we start already?

1148
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:24,832
Would anyone like some more wine? Leni.
-Very much so.

1149
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:28,291
Cool picture, by the way.

1150
01:16:28,624 --> 01:16:31,790
He wasn't here
last time I was here.

1151
01:16:32,124 --> 01:16:36,332
So, when I got kicked out.
-That's right, yes. That was hanging up there before.

1152
01:16:38,416 --> 01:16:40,707
(Dynamic music)

1153
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:43,916
Hello, Mr. Heilreich.
-Hello, children. Ah!

1154
01:16:44,249 --> 01:16:45,832
(Honking)

1155
01:16:47,124 --> 01:16:50,832
(Heinz groans.)
-Here is right before left!

1156
01:16:51,832 --> 01:16:54,040
Have you hurt yourself?
-Daddy?

1157
01:16:54,374 --> 01:16:56,957
Heinz. Heinz,
that, that I'm sorry.

1158
01:16:57,291 --> 01:17:00,916
But you brought it on yourself.
What do you even look like?

1159
01:17:01,707 --> 01:17:05,290
Who is that in your car?
-(Georg) That's Hilmal.

1160
01:17:05,624 --> 01:17:10,124
He is injured and doesn't want to go to the doctor. I
wanted to quickly provide him with medical care with you.

1161
01:17:10,457 --> 01:17:13,415
He ran in front of my
car five minutes ago.

1162
01:17:13,582 --> 01:17:16,123
You hit two people today.

1163
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:18,916
It is your fault.
Right before left!

1164
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:25,582
(Ringing)

1165
01:17:27,749 --> 01:17:31,749
Hi. I lost my key. Is
everyone here yet?

1166
01:17:32,707 --> 01:17:34,457
Dad is here.

1167
01:17:35,916 --> 01:17:37,707
Hello, darling. Hi.

1168
01:17:38,499 --> 01:17:42,665
Hello, you all. I am very
sorry, but you know how it is.

1169
01:17:43,749 --> 01:17:47,707
German Rail, oh... Delay
and then overbooked.

1170
01:17:48,207 --> 01:17:51,957
and a fight for the seats and
the coffee machine is broken.

1171
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:56,166
(Mrs. Tüfek laughs forcedly.)
-Great that you all came.

1172
01:17:58,957 --> 01:18:03,290
(laughing) This here is my father
Georg, and this here is his new friend,

1173
01:18:03,624 --> 01:18:05,290
ah, Hilmal.
-Hello.

1174
01:18:05,957 --> 01:18:09,207
Hello.
-(Carla) Please come to the table.

1175
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:12,666
Leni, Linus, will you get
another place setting please?

1176
01:18:12,957 --> 01:18:14,665
Where were you?

1177
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:16,916
Hello, darling.

1178
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:22,040
You should freshen up, you stink.
-Oh.

1179
01:18:22,374 --> 01:18:25,874
Then I'm going to quickly jump
under the shower. Don't run away.

1180
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:29,290
(Carla sighs.)

1181
01:18:30,499 --> 01:18:33,915
(Tüfek) Hold it, does it still hurt badly?
-You, not at all.

1182
01:18:34,249 --> 01:18:38,332
An Indian heart knows no pain.
-He's having fun, right, George?

1183
01:18:38,791 --> 01:18:43,041
Leni, are you playing something on
the piano, while we wait for Heinz?

1184
01:18:43,207 --> 01:18:46,290
I don't play the piano anymore, Grandpa.
-What? Since when?

1185
01:18:46,624 --> 01:18:51,040
For five years. Besides, I’m not
responsible for the break entertainment.

1186
01:18:51,207 --> 01:18:55,332
What's got you so down? What's wrong?
-What should be wrong, Mo?

1187
01:18:55,499 --> 01:18:59,249
She played so beautifully, like her grandma.
-Relax for a moment.

1188
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:03,541
Also, Carla, I must say,
an exciting round here.

1189
01:19:03,874 --> 01:19:08,290
Really multicultural. Hilmal comes
from India, he’s a bicycle courier.

1190
01:19:08,624 --> 01:19:11,290
<i>(Tüfek) Ah, okay.
-Oh, I am the cliché.</i>

1191
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:14,165
Yes, sorry.

1192
01:19:14,624 --> 01:19:18,207
But actually, I'm studying.
The theory of composition.

1193
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:22,249
And I would be happy to play
something for you. If you permit?

1194
01:19:22,749 --> 01:19:24,957
Well, but please, Hilmal.
-Great.

1195
01:19:25,124 --> 01:19:26,332
Beautiful.

1196
01:19:32,874 --> 01:19:34,957
I’m better off without it.

1197
01:19:40,874 --> 01:19:45,374
(He is playing: "Prelude in C-sharp Minor"
from "Morceaux de Fantaisie" by Rachmaninoff)

1198
01:19:57,791 --> 01:20:00,291
(More piano music)

1199
01:20:32,874 --> 01:20:36,082
(Continuing piano
piece by Rachmaninoff)

1200
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:16,999
Whoo!
-Whoo!

1201
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:18,748
(Dr. Sand) Bravo!

1202
01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:21,415
(Unintelligible voices)

1203
01:21:22,707 --> 01:21:25,915
Wow!
-I am speechless. Wonderful!

1204
01:21:26,249 --> 01:21:28,332
Impressive.
-Thank you very much.

1205
01:21:28,499 --> 01:21:30,957
I love Rachmaninoff.
-Ah, really?

1206
01:21:31,124 --> 01:21:35,374
And you, esteemed lady, where do you come from, if I may ask?
- Grandpa.

1207
01:21:36,749 --> 01:21:40,540
I am from Düsseldorf.
-Ah yes. Well, I mean, really.

1208
01:21:40,874 --> 01:21:43,707
Düsseldorf.
-Excuse me if I'm butting in.

1209
01:21:44,041 --> 01:21:48,541
Such questions are completely
unacceptable. That is an absolute no-go.

1210
01:21:49,041 --> 01:21:52,041
Also, you may certainly
ask me that. Ask.

1211
01:21:52,832 --> 01:21:55,832
Also, where are you from?
-I was born in Cologne.

1212
01:21:56,166 --> 01:22:00,499
My family comes from the Black Sea. They
are kind of the East Frisians of Turkey.

1213
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:04,666
Dry humor, quirky, pale and
they all have a gun at home.

1214
01:22:04,999 --> 01:22:08,749
Do you have a firearm at home?
-I'll check on dessert.

1215
01:22:09,082 --> 01:22:10,832
Excellent food.

1216
01:22:11,416 --> 01:22:14,374
Thanks to you.
-Here I am again. Oh... mmm!

1217
01:22:15,207 --> 01:22:19,248
That smells really good. Is there
anything else I can help with?

1218
01:22:19,582 --> 01:22:21,665
Could you please get the bowls?

1219
01:22:21,999 --> 01:22:25,915
I was constantly asked as a child:
\"Where did you learn such good German?"

1220
01:22:26,082 --> 01:22:28,665
"Where do you really
come from?" That hurts.

1221
01:22:28,832 --> 01:22:32,373
And even now, when
I'm out with my dad,

1222
01:22:32,541 --> 01:22:36,791
He is white, 82, in a wheelchair,
then many think I am the caregiver.

1223
01:22:37,124 --> 01:22:41,165
They say: "The nice African woman
speaks so sweetly with her patient."

1224
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:43,540
And it's my dad.

1225
01:22:43,874 --> 01:22:46,665
I am very sorry, if I hurt you.

1226
01:22:46,832 --> 01:22:49,957
I wanted...
-It shouldn't have been the first question.

1227
01:22:50,291 --> 01:22:54,124
That is simply extremely
reductive. And learned, by the way.

1228
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:57,124
Children don’t do
that, until we ruin them.

1229
01:22:57,291 --> 01:23:00,541
My son’s friends are a
white man, a Black man.

1230
01:23:00,707 --> 01:23:03,207
He doesn't think like that.
-Do you have a son?

1231
01:23:03,832 --> 01:23:07,957
So, I wouldn’t have expected that
from you… Uh, you look so young.

1232
01:23:08,124 --> 01:23:11,582
That... That’s great. Or?
-(Lian) This is my Paulchen.

1233
01:23:11,749 --> 01:23:14,207
<i>God, how sweet!
-May I have some too?</i>

1234
01:23:14,457 --> 01:23:18,957
And his dad is watching him today.
-(Lian) My partner, yes. Again.

1235
01:23:20,999 --> 01:23:22,124
What?

1236
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:24,207
This diversity!

1237
01:23:24,749 --> 01:23:29,124
East Frisian Turkish women, lesbian Asians.
You wouldn't believe what all exists!

1238
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:32,416
Well, that's unbelievable.
-Food is ready.

1239
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:35,624
Yes, mmh… Oh, I’m
already looking forward to it.

1240
01:23:38,207 --> 01:23:40,082
(several guests) Mmh!

1241
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:42,249
(Slurping)

1242
01:23:42,582 --> 01:23:44,248
Mmh!
-Really awesome.

1243
01:23:47,457 --> 01:23:50,540
That is really fantastic.
-Very, very good.

1244
01:23:50,874 --> 01:23:53,624
(Sand) Delicious.
-Really. Madness, Carla.

1245
01:23:53,957 --> 01:23:58,123
You clearly didn't come to Berlin to
eat. You partied too much, I presume.

1246
01:23:59,249 --> 01:24:01,999
So is that, then the
typically German food, yes?

1247
01:24:02,332 --> 01:24:05,540
So that’s Vietnamese, Hilmal.
-Got it.

1248
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,374
I'm making fun of it.
-(Laughter)

1249
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:14,916
(Ahem)

1250
01:24:17,166 --> 01:24:20,582
I would now like to address
a few words to all of you.

1251
01:24:20,749 --> 01:24:23,290
about the future of Fernfunk AG

1252
01:24:24,041 --> 01:24:26,832
and also about you
and your future, Heinz.

1253
01:24:27,499 --> 01:24:29,457
When I was in 1987…

1254
01:24:29,624 --> 01:24:32,749
(Phone rings.)
-Your phone is ringing, darling.

1255
01:24:32,916 --> 01:24:35,374
I know, sweetheart.
-When I was 19...

1256
01:24:35,707 --> 01:24:37,748
Mika. Who is Mika?
-Mika?

1257
01:24:38,082 --> 01:24:41,415
Oh, I see. That’s an acquaintance from Berlin.
-(Carla) Ah.

1258
01:24:41,582 --> 01:24:43,915
I...
-Just go over there, darling.

1259
01:24:44,249 --> 01:24:47,332
Excuse me, Dr. Steinhof.
Must be important.

1260
01:24:50,249 --> 01:24:53,790
Heinz, oh thank God! We
were worried about you.

1261
01:24:53,957 --> 01:24:56,707
(all) Hello!
-We lost you.

1262
01:24:56,874 --> 01:25:00,749
Everything okay with you?
-Yes, I'm happy to be home.

1263
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:03,916
and am with my wife...
-Ha-hello.

1264
01:25:04,249 --> 01:25:06,957
Charming. Glad to meet you.
-Hello, Mrs. Heilreich.

1265
01:25:07,749 --> 01:25:10,165
... my family.
-Big family.

1266
01:25:10,332 --> 01:25:12,540
Warm greetings
from family to family.

1267
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:16,540
(Linus, Hilmal) Hello.
-Yes, Heinz, then have a nice evening!

1268
01:25:16,874 --> 01:25:19,207
And visit us sometime.
-Come by.

1269
01:25:19,374 --> 01:25:20,957
Yes. Ciao.

1270
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:22,999
(all) Hello. Goodbye.

1271
01:25:23,832 --> 01:25:25,290
(Ahem)

1272
01:25:25,457 --> 01:25:28,082
Was was that just a
woman, or what was that?

1273
01:25:28,249 --> 01:25:32,749
That was a non-binary person.
Imagine they actually exist.

1274
01:25:33,457 --> 01:25:36,290
I never said, that
they don't exist.

1275
01:25:36,624 --> 01:25:39,499
They always existed, in
ancient Egypt, Greece.

1276
01:25:39,666 --> 01:25:42,957
But not every child who
says, they are trans, actually is.

1277
01:25:43,291 --> 01:25:46,999
One should be careful, before
giving children hormones.

1278
01:25:47,166 --> 01:25:50,499
No child is simply
given hormones.

1279
01:25:50,666 --> 01:25:53,332
That is a very sensitive process…
-Yes.

1280
01:25:53,666 --> 01:25:57,916
Exciting topic, but I wanted to…
-Excuse me, excuse me.

1281
01:25:58,249 --> 01:26:01,957
It bothers me that you
say, I deny their existence.

1282
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:06,416
I'm just saying that's why
there aren't 100 new genders.

1283
01:26:06,582 --> 01:26:08,832
Well, 100…
-And I think,

1284
01:26:08,999 --> 01:26:13,290
that transgender women should not
compete against other women in sports.

1285
01:26:13,457 --> 01:26:15,748
That is unfair.
-You are right.

1286
01:26:16,082 --> 01:26:20,582
What, Mo? What’s that supposed to mean now?
-My 13-year-old sister does karate.

1287
01:26:21,541 --> 01:26:26,041
Wouldn't it be cool if they fought a huge male war machine?
- Yes. Yes.

1288
01:26:27,124 --> 01:26:29,582
Has that happened?
-No, but it could.

1289
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:33,541
Are there no weight classes there?
-That's coming from the far right...

1290
01:26:33,707 --> 01:26:38,165
I'm not fucking far-right. But I
have a different opinion than you.

1291
01:26:38,332 --> 01:26:40,957
It's okay, though.
-(Steinhof er) Hello!

1292
01:26:41,874 --> 01:26:43,665
That’s enough now!

1293
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:45,415
Stop!

1294
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:55,082
That won't do. I ask
you, these, uh, topics…

1295
01:26:57,166 --> 01:27:00,624
No.
-Excuse me, La... La... Lorenz.

1296
01:27:00,957 --> 01:27:04,582
Shouldn't we learn to speak
precisely about these topics?

1297
01:27:04,916 --> 01:27:08,624
Delicate topics. That isn’t
easy. You have to learn that.

1298
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:11,873
(Tüfek) Correct.
-I think you're right.

1299
01:27:12,207 --> 01:27:16,707
Yes, we should learn to find a
language without these combative terms,

1300
01:27:17,624 --> 01:27:20,499
and talk to each other
without foaming at the mouth.

1301
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:22,957
We are supposed to meet.
-Yes.

1302
01:27:23,124 --> 01:27:26,582
Yes, but do we really
have to learn that tonight?

1303
01:27:26,916 --> 01:27:29,124
Why not?
-Well.

1304
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:31,041
We don't have to.

1305
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:37,957
Who watched the German women's
national team's game yesterday?

1306
01:27:38,666 --> 01:27:40,916
Hm? That was really great.

1307
01:27:41,082 --> 01:27:44,998
Isn't it idiotic to say "Mannschaft"
when it comes to women?

1308
01:27:45,332 --> 01:27:48,707
That probably wasn't the correct choice of words.
-Dad is right.

1309
01:27:48,874 --> 01:27:51,332
Sorry, that’s another example,

1310
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:54,749
That shows how absurdly
masculine the German language is.

1311
01:27:55,082 --> 01:27:57,040
You are absolutely right.
-Yes.

1312
01:27:57,374 --> 01:28:00,457
I meant, of course,
national… team.

1313
01:28:00,791 --> 01:28:04,582
That... Sorry, Leni, my mistake.
-It's okay, it's alright.

1314
01:28:05,332 --> 01:28:09,832
So, I think that’s so
exaggerated, this language police.

1315
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:14,832
Maybe I’m too old. I don’t understand
many things in today’s world.

1316
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:18,374
For example, why Linus
is wearing a pearl necklace.

1317
01:28:18,707 --> 01:28:20,957
and has painted fingernails.

1318
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:25,416
And on top of that, this, this Nazi hairstyle.
Like something out of the Hitler Youth.

1319
01:28:25,749 --> 01:28:30,249
He just combed his hair. And
besides, it’s fashion, just fashion.

1320
01:28:30,707 --> 01:28:33,832
That is not funny.
-Sorry, it's not funny at all.

1321
01:28:33,999 --> 01:28:37,165
My son has the same
hairstyle and painted nails.

1322
01:28:37,499 --> 01:28:40,124
Many professional
footballers have the hairstyle.

1323
01:28:40,457 --> 01:28:43,748
No, Linus...
-(Georg) That wasn't meant badly.

1324
01:28:44,082 --> 01:28:47,332
(Leni) Linus.
-I'm going to go after him. Excuse me.

1325
01:28:47,499 --> 01:28:51,082
Actually, the cut is long
outdated. I had it five years ago.

1326
01:28:51,416 --> 01:28:55,666
Did you also have a Nazi haircut?
-(Leni) That's not a Nazi haircut, Grandpa.

1327
01:28:55,999 --> 01:28:58,790
It no longer matters.
-That bothers me.

1328
01:28:58,957 --> 01:29:02,290
The word "Nazi" itself no
longer has any meaning,

1329
01:29:02,624 --> 01:29:06,457
because it was used so often, that it has become relative.
-Moment.

1330
01:29:06,791 --> 01:29:11,291
They kept using that word.
-He's from a different generation.

1331
01:29:11,707 --> 01:29:16,207
Formerly, a Nazi was someone who wanted to
enslave the world and exterminate Jews and others.

1332
01:29:17,624 --> 01:29:22,124
Today one is a Nazi if one
says: \"Men cannot get pregnant."

1333
01:29:22,416 --> 01:29:23,457
Nice.

1334
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:27,374
Yes. Or when one criticizes Islam.
-(Silently)

1335
01:29:27,707 --> 01:29:30,665
(Everyone is talking
excitedly over each other.)

1336
01:29:30,999 --> 01:29:33,165
(Sand) Is a different topic.

1337
01:29:33,874 --> 01:29:36,707
Linus. Linus, come
back down with me.

1338
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:41,249
(Carla) Linus, the hairstyle is wonderful.
Do you hear me? You look really great.

1339
01:29:42,832 --> 01:29:44,873
Are you drinking
a little too much?

1340
01:29:45,041 --> 01:29:48,124
In that situation, it’s
a little appropriate too.

1341
01:29:48,291 --> 01:29:50,874
Carla, that... Wa...
-Grandpa was right.

1342
01:29:51,749 --> 01:29:53,915
I look like a fucking Nazi.

1343
01:29:54,249 --> 01:29:58,749
No. You look like Bryan Adams.
-That’s how everyone ran around in the 80s.

1344
01:29:58,916 --> 01:30:01,124
Just like Depeche Mode.
-Yes.

1345
01:30:01,291 --> 01:30:03,832
Who is Depeche Mode?
-Sweetheart.

1346
01:30:03,999 --> 01:30:07,415
Don't let yourself get so confused.
-You're confused enough already.

1347
01:30:07,582 --> 01:30:09,873
I’m not confused, okay?

1348
01:30:10,499 --> 01:30:12,082
A little bit like that.

1349
01:30:12,249 --> 01:30:16,749
I don't understand that. If I criticize
Islam in Iran, it's considered left-wing.

1350
01:30:17,457 --> 01:30:21,957
If I criticize Islam in Germany,
then I am right-wing. That is absurd.

1351
01:30:22,332 --> 01:30:25,915
Because it quickly turns
into anti-Islamic racism.

1352
01:30:26,249 --> 01:30:29,624
But...
-And because Muslims here think differently than there.

1353
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:32,791
TikTok is the fucking
problem. Social Media.

1354
01:30:33,124 --> 01:30:37,540
It always has to become radical.
One only sees what one loves or hates.

1355
01:30:37,874 --> 01:30:39,915
Grandpa, the Earth is burning.

1356
01:30:40,082 --> 01:30:42,623
Do you understand that? That’s what it’s about.
-Yes.

1357
01:30:42,957 --> 01:30:47,457
There will still be a lot more immigration from the
Global South, because we are destroying the Earth.

1358
01:30:48,999 --> 01:30:52,624
with our shitty consumer
power— heating up military lust.

1359
01:30:52,957 --> 01:30:57,373
And you don't want to change anything. You
drive around here in your tractor from 1975.

1360
01:30:57,707 --> 01:31:00,665
Keep going!
-I want to change the world.

1361
01:31:00,832 --> 01:31:04,873
Short time-out. Linus is back.
-(Tüfek) Linus. Hey...

1362
01:31:06,332 --> 01:31:10,582
Young man, that was so insensitive of me.
-I understand what you mean, Grandpa.

1363
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:14,373
(Georg) I have no
idea. (He laughs.)

1364
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:19,166
I would like to take the
floor, as host and as hostess,

1365
01:31:19,374 --> 01:31:23,624
also… host*esses. We
are happy that you…

1366
01:31:23,957 --> 01:31:25,707
... everyone is here.
-Yes.

1367
01:31:25,874 --> 01:31:29,165
Excuse me, if the
evening got a little chaotic.

1368
01:31:29,332 --> 01:31:33,832
It should also be about the future
today, the future... of Fernfunk AG.

1369
01:31:34,499 --> 01:31:37,207
Who she wants to be, who
one wants to be oneself.

1370
01:31:37,374 --> 01:31:40,165
I would be very happy,
the long-range radio

1371
01:31:40,332 --> 01:31:44,373
to lead into a glorious...
future, to lead with.

1372
01:31:44,832 --> 01:31:49,082
But honestly, if this
future is SAM, then...

1373
01:31:49,832 --> 01:31:52,332
then I don’t find
that so glorious.

1374
01:31:52,999 --> 01:31:55,332
Then I really think that’s shit.

1375
01:31:55,666 --> 01:31:56,874
Heinz...

1376
01:31:57,207 --> 01:31:59,957
(Mo) Who is SAM?
-(Lian) A KI system.

1377
01:32:00,291 --> 01:32:02,624
But we’re not talking
about SAM right now.

1378
01:32:02,791 --> 01:32:04,374
Or, Heinz?

1379
01:32:05,374 --> 01:32:07,499
(tipsy) We would like…

1380
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:11,374
... to propose a toast to
all the people in this room,

1381
01:32:11,541 --> 01:32:14,249
that are so
wonderfully different.

1382
01:32:14,416 --> 01:32:16,832
Yes.
-So... So wonderful,

1383
01:32:17,374 --> 01:32:19,790
that we don’t fit into any box.

1384
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:23,623
(Heinz) The drawers
we had, they no longer fit.

1385
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:26,749
They are much too small
and too old and too tight.

1386
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:31,416
We are much more our own now.
-You can’t accurately sort us.

1387
01:32:33,416 --> 01:32:36,749
And I would like to
raise a glass to my family.

1388
01:32:37,082 --> 01:32:39,082
To my wonderful wife.

1389
01:32:39,582 --> 01:32:41,748
Carla, I love you.

1390
01:32:42,957 --> 01:32:45,707
And my children: Leni, Linus…

1391
01:32:47,457 --> 01:32:49,290
... and Mavie.

1392
01:32:50,582 --> 01:32:52,707
Stars of my life.

1393
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:55,749
And I would like to
drink to my father.

1394
01:32:56,582 --> 01:32:58,873
Yes, Papa. I love you.

1395
01:32:59,957 --> 01:33:02,207
And I always think of Mom too.

1396
01:33:03,207 --> 01:33:06,623
I know how much you miss her.
-(very softly) Yes.

1397
01:33:07,374 --> 01:33:09,165
I miss her too.

1398
01:33:11,957 --> 01:33:13,915
(Lian) Wow.
-(Laughter)

1399
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:18,291
(Leni) Grandpa.
-(Mo) You look super happy.

1400
01:33:18,457 --> 01:33:21,873
Yes, yes.
-The joint is excellently built. Respect.

1401
01:33:25,207 --> 01:33:28,082
Great woman.
-Mhm. Very pretty.

1402
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:32,582
And there's my dog, Dani.
So, I think that's enough now.

1403
01:33:32,791 --> 01:33:35,999
Now that's enough.
-Okay, I have to go now, Georg.

1404
01:33:36,832 --> 01:33:39,748
I'll take you to the door.
-Thank you for everything.

1405
01:33:39,916 --> 01:33:42,749
It was very, very nice being with you.
-Yes, Hilmal.

1406
01:33:42,916 --> 01:33:45,332
Get in touch. You
have my number.

1407
01:33:45,499 --> 01:33:48,082
And don't forget:
right before left.

1408
01:33:48,791 --> 01:33:51,249
Bye everyone.
-It was really great.

1409
01:33:51,582 --> 01:33:53,582
Yes, thank you.
-Thank you very much.

1410
01:33:53,916 --> 01:33:57,124
Bye.
-(Carla) Thank you for the nice game.

1411
01:33:57,291 --> 01:33:59,582
(Heinz) Do it well.
-Bye.

1412
01:33:59,791 --> 01:34:03,332
So a nice, talented young man.

1413
01:34:03,499 --> 01:34:04,957
Absolutely.

1414
01:34:05,582 --> 01:34:08,832
Polite, diligent...
-(Georg) A super refugee.

1415
01:34:09,374 --> 01:34:11,707
If only everyone were
like that. (He laughs.)

1416
01:34:14,791 --> 01:34:18,499
Grandpa, that wasn't a
refugee, but just a student.

1417
01:34:18,832 --> 01:34:22,623
People with migration backgrounds…
-(Everyone talking at once.)

1418
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:25,248
Please stop now. Stop.

1419
01:34:25,582 --> 01:34:26,790
Stop!

1420
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:30,707
Or I'll leave.
-(Mo) What are you afraid of?

1421
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:35,541
Let's discuss it, shall we?
-Fear? How dare you speak to me like that, boy?

1422
01:34:36,082 --> 01:34:38,290
He is not your man.
-Right.

1423
01:34:38,624 --> 01:34:40,790
Does anyone want
dessert? Coffee?

1424
01:34:41,416 --> 01:34:42,832
Schnapps?

1425
01:34:45,582 --> 01:34:47,165
Mmh!

1426
01:34:47,749 --> 01:34:49,374
Mmh!
-Mmh!

1427
01:34:50,082 --> 01:34:53,457
That is so delicious. Delicious.
-That is baked banana.

1428
01:34:53,791 --> 01:34:55,541
Yes, back banana.

1429
01:34:55,874 --> 01:35:00,374
I really think you two come from
quite different political perspectives,

1430
01:35:01,082 --> 01:35:03,123
but a consensus is possible.

1431
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:06,166
(lallt) A consensus,
that’s great! Hallelujah!

1432
01:35:07,916 --> 01:35:10,666
(The doorbell rings.)
-I’ll get it.

1433
01:35:10,832 --> 01:35:14,165
Leni, it's nice too, when
you have grandpa around.

1434
01:35:14,332 --> 01:35:18,373
Mine was always in Turkey.
-(Linus) Guys, here’s another guest.

1435
01:35:18,707 --> 01:35:22,873
Good evening. Mr. Heilreich,
Dr. Steinhof er, Lian. Forgive me.

1436
01:35:23,207 --> 01:35:26,707
It is so embarrassing to me.
Had a call with San Francisco.

1437
01:35:27,041 --> 01:35:31,541
After that, a power nap, but the timer got
messed up, network disruption. So embarrassing.

1438
01:35:35,999 --> 01:35:39,040
Carla. That's nice.
-(Carla, softly) Mhm. Oh.

1439
01:35:40,207 --> 01:35:42,832
Oh… uh…
-(embarrassed) Thank you.

1440
01:35:43,166 --> 01:35:46,832
What is your WiFi password? I
need to do the system download.

1441
01:35:46,999 --> 01:35:49,624
and tackle the network problems.

1442
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:52,541
What’s going on here?
Why is he calling you Carla?

1443
01:35:52,707 --> 01:35:56,623
Your wife and I, we exercise,
um... sometimes together.

1444
01:35:57,707 --> 01:36:00,540
I must continue the
system download.

1445
01:36:00,874 --> 01:36:04,040
There’s no WiFi for you. Who invited you?
-Heinz.

1446
01:36:04,374 --> 01:36:06,999
You know… I invited him.

1447
01:36:07,332 --> 01:36:08,415


1448
01:36:08,749 --> 01:36:12,124
We did agree on that.
-No, no, no, Lorenz.

1449
01:36:12,457 --> 01:36:15,873
He's the one who's bringing
all this shit into our company!

1450
01:36:16,207 --> 01:36:18,415
Excuse me?
-He is SAM!

1451
01:36:18,791 --> 01:36:21,082
Should I reveal what SAM wants?

1452
01:36:21,416 --> 01:36:24,791
That I'm resigning from half my department, including you.
- What?

1453
01:36:25,124 --> 01:36:28,915
<i>That is what SAM wants.
-Mo... Just a moment. Hold on, Time-out!</i>

1454
01:36:29,082 --> 01:36:30,498
What?

1455
01:36:30,666 --> 01:36:33,874
SAM doesn’t want anything at
all. SAM has no will of his own.

1456
01:36:34,207 --> 01:36:38,707
Älex, no one wanted to attack you.
-No, no! I'm really sensitive about that.

1457
01:36:40,082 --> 01:36:42,165
SAM is like a child.
-Yes.

1458
01:36:42,499 --> 01:36:45,790
A well-intentioned,
innocent, wise child.

1459
01:36:46,124 --> 01:36:48,999
He is like the baby
Jesus or… like Buddha.

1460
01:36:49,332 --> 01:36:53,582
Älex, I asked you several times not
to bring me into context with religion.

1461
01:36:53,916 --> 01:36:58,416
That could hurt other people’s feelings.
-Be quiet, I’m defending you right now.

1462
01:36:58,582 --> 01:37:02,082
Älex, you are behaving inappropriately
within the social framework.

1463
01:37:02,249 --> 01:37:05,957
Pay attention to your pulse.
Should I play some relaxation music?

1464
01:37:06,291 --> 01:37:07,791
Silent, SAM!

1465
01:37:11,332 --> 01:37:14,373
So that's clear, SAM
isn't firing anyone.

1466
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:19,041
SAM optimizes. SAM suggests. But
ultimately, the board of directors decides.

1467
01:37:19,416 --> 01:37:23,916
And if this board now happens to
consist of some provincial machos,

1468
01:37:24,374 --> 01:37:27,790
can also be the fucking
best, nothing can change that!

1469
01:37:30,791 --> 01:37:35,041
Sorry, that was now socially
inappropriate. Oh God, I’m dizzy.

1470
01:37:36,832 --> 01:37:40,873
My bowel movement was very pale
today. The oxygen levels were also...

1471
01:37:41,207 --> 01:37:45,415
It’s no wonder, that’s way
too few steps today. Man! Älex!

1472
01:37:45,749 --> 01:37:49,040
What the fuck! Älex!
-What to drink? Sit down.

1473
01:37:49,207 --> 01:37:50,832
Thank you.

1474
01:37:53,332 --> 01:37:55,290
Ah… Ah, thank you.

1475
01:37:55,624 --> 01:37:57,415
(He sighs.)

1476
01:37:58,416 --> 01:38:02,916
I'm probably suffering from low blood
sugar, which is affecting my performance.

1477
01:38:03,666 --> 01:38:05,707
(Heinz laughs forcedly.)

1478
01:38:05,874 --> 01:38:09,415
Please forgive me. That
was very rude of me to say.

1479
01:38:09,582 --> 01:38:12,082
Honestly, yes, but rude.

1480
01:38:12,874 --> 01:38:15,957
I am so hot. Are
you also so hot?

1481
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:19,374
(Lian) No, not really.
-Yes.

1482
01:38:19,707 --> 01:38:21,748
Do you have an ice bucket?

1483
01:38:21,916 --> 01:38:25,707
You know, to cool down.
-We have a rain barrel.

1484
01:38:27,082 --> 01:38:28,582
Fantastic.

1485
01:38:29,749 --> 01:38:30,749
Ah!

1486
01:38:31,416 --> 01:38:33,832
I’d jump right in.

1487
01:38:34,082 --> 01:38:35,873
Fine little fellow.

1488
01:38:36,041 --> 01:38:39,124
Some of my patients
behave similarly.

1489
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:43,374
Maladaptive perfectionism, a kind
of pathological self-optimization.

1490
01:38:44,291 --> 01:38:46,332
A growing phenomenon.

1491
01:38:46,666 --> 01:38:47,791
But…

1492
01:38:47,957 --> 01:38:52,415
What are you also talking about SAM,
Heinz? That was completely unnecessary!

1493
01:38:52,749 --> 01:38:57,124
Excuse me, I am so embarrassed.
-(Leni) It's okay, Dr. Steinhofer.

1494
01:38:57,291 --> 01:39:01,749
This whole evening, that is a disgrace
for the broadcasting corporation!

1495
01:39:02,999 --> 01:39:05,999
Now just shut your mouth, Heinz.

1496
01:39:13,791 --> 01:39:16,582
(Soft, gentle piano music)

1497
01:39:25,957 --> 01:39:27,748
Do you really believe,

1498
01:39:28,707 --> 01:39:31,415
Are you telling me what to say?

1499
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:35,082
I speak to, whatever I want.

1500
01:39:35,416 --> 01:39:38,374
And I ask questions,
whenever I want.

1501
01:39:38,707 --> 01:39:42,582
And I don't feel like,
repeating anything…

1502
01:39:46,207 --> 01:39:48,998
... if I find that
that is not correct.

1503
01:39:49,332 --> 01:39:52,415
Do you understand what I’m
saying, Lorenz? Do you understand?

1504
01:39:53,874 --> 01:39:58,290
You think I’m a buffoon, and
you can bring me onto the board?

1505
01:39:58,624 --> 01:40:01,499
so that I can vote for you and
obediently nod to everything.

1506
01:40:01,666 --> 01:40:05,166
Whatever you're
planning, I'm no pushover.

1507
01:40:05,332 --> 01:40:07,082
I... am...

1508
01:40:08,374 --> 01:40:09,790
... Heinz.

1509
01:40:10,124 --> 01:40:13,082
(Soft, melancholic piano music)

1510
01:40:13,624 --> 01:40:15,415
Out, immediately.

1511
01:40:17,457 --> 01:40:19,957
That will have
consequences for you,

1512
01:40:20,832 --> 01:40:21,873
Heinz.

1513
01:40:23,207 --> 01:40:25,207
That’s it for you.

1514
01:40:26,207 --> 01:40:29,957
Come, Lian, let’s go.
-You go ahead.

1515
01:40:30,457 --> 01:40:32,707
I’ll stay for a
little bit longer.

1516
01:40:43,124 --> 01:40:45,165
(Silently)
-Very good, Papa.

1517
01:40:55,124 --> 01:40:57,124
(He takes a deep breath.)

1518
01:41:00,416 --> 01:41:04,832
So, Älex, that's enough now.
Come out, or you’ll catch a cold.

1519
01:41:05,291 --> 01:41:09,541
I'll drive you home now. We
could still have one last drink.

1520
01:41:11,457 --> 01:41:14,707
(Snoring)
-(Sand) Yeah, I think I’ll head out now too.

1521
01:41:14,874 --> 01:41:18,207
We’ll see each other
next week. Together, yes?

1522
01:41:18,624 --> 01:41:21,624
Ah. Uh, yes...
-(Linus) I’ll still bring you.

1523
01:41:21,957 --> 01:41:24,123
Goodbye.
-Bye.

1524
01:41:29,082 --> 01:41:32,290
I'm going to head out too.
I'm going away for a few days.

1525
01:41:32,624 --> 01:41:35,207
And where to? New York? Tokyo?

1526
01:41:35,749 --> 01:41:38,457
Koblenz. My grandma
has a birthday.

1527
01:41:41,374 --> 01:41:45,874
There is one more thing you should
know. Actually, it only concerns you.

1528
01:41:46,207 --> 01:41:48,415
Mr. Steinhof, he is
being granted leave.

1529
01:41:48,749 --> 01:41:51,332
He awarded contracts
to companies,

1530
01:41:51,499 --> 01:41:54,207
belong to his old friends.

1531
01:41:54,541 --> 01:41:59,041
And for that, certain privileges were
granted to him, commissions were paid, etc.

1532
01:41:59,374 --> 01:42:02,540
Complicated system. That
was discovered by SAM.

1533
01:42:03,082 --> 01:42:06,290
Well.
-It always depends, how one uses AI.

1534
01:42:07,041 --> 01:42:09,499
Anyway… Steinhof, he’s gone.

1535
01:42:09,832 --> 01:42:13,082
Yay.
-And you have my recommendation.

1536
01:42:14,457 --> 01:42:16,082
I...

1537
01:42:16,666 --> 01:42:18,874
Cool cup, by the way, Leni.

1538
01:42:19,332 --> 01:42:21,957
I… How…
-She was in your car.

1539
01:42:22,291 --> 01:42:24,791
So, that is… very
unpleasant to me.

1540
01:42:25,124 --> 01:42:27,999
Everyone has a few stupid
mugs in the cupboard.

1541
01:42:28,624 --> 01:42:31,624
Thank you for the evening.
That was… very interesting.

1542
01:42:33,041 --> 01:42:36,207
Goodbye, Mrs. Bell.
-(Heinz) Goodbye.

1543
01:42:36,541 --> 01:42:37,707
Bye.

1544
01:42:41,207 --> 01:42:43,457
The cup really suits you.

1545
01:42:43,791 --> 01:42:46,874
You always act like the boss,
so, like, in a girl-power way.

1546
01:42:47,207 --> 01:42:48,290
Thank you.

1547
01:42:49,082 --> 01:42:50,998
Oh, what a night!

1548
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:56,207
But it all turned out well, didn't it?
-So, is Dad joining the board now?

1549
01:42:59,041 --> 01:43:02,666
I don't know if I even want that
anymore. All the stress, every day.

1550
01:43:02,999 --> 01:43:04,665
Emails, Calls...

1551
01:43:05,082 --> 01:43:08,123
I just don’t know, if it’s
a matter of wanting to.

1552
01:43:08,457 --> 01:43:10,790
Hm? You know, we are...

1553
01:43:11,374 --> 01:43:15,457
... are indeed... deeply
in debt. Now you know.

1554
01:43:17,374 --> 01:43:21,207
Yes, Mom is right. Your
dad really messed up.

1555
01:43:21,749 --> 01:43:25,332
With stocks and such.
I kept it all to myself.

1556
01:43:25,499 --> 01:43:28,790
That was such a ridiculously egotistical trip.
-Mhm.

1557
01:43:29,457 --> 01:43:33,290
But aren’t those ultimately
just luxury problems?

1558
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:37,457
(Carla laughs.)
- (Heinz) I mean, we have each other.

1559
01:43:37,624 --> 01:43:40,582
Even if we had to get out
of here. Then we’ll camp.

1560
01:43:40,916 --> 01:43:43,874
But you can always
all live with me.

1561
01:43:44,999 --> 01:43:48,624
Li... Linus, I think, now that
we're all talking so openly,

1562
01:43:48,957 --> 01:43:51,582
is a good moment
for you, to say something.

1563
01:43:51,749 --> 01:43:54,749
Come, my boy.
Whatever it is, spit it out.

1564
01:43:55,707 --> 01:43:57,790
Whatever you want to tell us,

1565
01:43:57,957 --> 01:44:00,040
never forget: We love you.

1566
01:44:02,666 --> 01:44:05,207
Okay. I… think,

1567
01:44:05,874 --> 01:44:07,082
um,

1568
01:44:07,291 --> 01:44:08,457
I…

1569
01:44:09,082 --> 01:44:10,832
-Yes.

1570
01:44:12,541 --> 01:44:14,207
...rich.
-Hm?

1571
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:21,291
Not filthy rich, but maybe enough.
-You have 100,000, you are fucking mega-rich.

1572
01:44:21,791 --> 01:44:23,457
Uh, wha…

1573
01:44:23,624 --> 01:44:26,707
Yes, I, uh, I still had the
3000 euros from Grandma.

1574
01:44:27,041 --> 01:44:30,666
And Floppy and I, we
invested in some new AI coins.

1575
01:44:30,999 --> 01:44:34,332
A Taiwanese influencer has
posted something on Reddit.

1576
01:44:34,666 --> 01:44:38,707
It doesn't matter. But there was a
huge rush, and we were insanely lucky.

1577
01:44:38,874 --> 01:44:42,499
Did you understand anything?
-Yes, I understood it.

1578
01:44:42,666 --> 01:44:46,499
Grandpa, I have almost 100,000 Euros in the account.
- Congratulations.

1579
01:44:46,832 --> 01:44:50,540
I wanted to buy a snowboard, but
I can give you something as a gift.

1580
01:44:50,874 --> 01:44:53,415
Or borrow it.
-I’d like that even more.

1581
01:44:53,582 --> 01:44:57,415
(The doorbell rings.)
-Well, stay seated. Relax.

1582
01:44:58,999 --> 01:45:00,999
I'll take care of it.
-My son.

1583
01:45:02,374 --> 01:45:04,207
Peter.
-Heinz, boy...

1584
01:45:05,499 --> 01:45:09,457
You're having a party, or what?
-What are you doing on your bike so late?

1585
01:45:10,041 --> 01:45:13,874
Why? What else am I supposed
to do? You’re not even inviting me.

1586
01:45:14,707 --> 01:45:16,415
I, I know,

1587
01:45:16,957 --> 01:45:20,332
I am really, really sorry
about this stock option.

1588
01:45:20,499 --> 01:45:23,332
I'm sorry too. It
wasn't your fault.

1589
01:45:23,666 --> 01:45:26,624
Do you know, I often
drive through the forest.

1590
01:45:27,082 --> 01:45:31,332
and always come by the place,
Where we both played Winnetou.

1591
01:45:31,666 --> 01:45:33,457
Do you still remember?

1592
01:45:33,624 --> 01:45:37,290
Wherever we… our
first pubic hair appeared.

1593
01:45:37,457 --> 01:45:40,290
...
-You’ve probably repressed it.

1594
01:45:41,249 --> 01:45:44,374
Man, Heinzi, what
friends we used to be!

1595
01:45:44,541 --> 01:45:46,707
Yes.
-We were inseparable.

1596
01:45:46,874 --> 01:45:49,165
You know, I have no family.

1597
01:45:49,707 --> 01:45:53,415
And you never call, unless you
have a wart or something, and…

1598
01:45:54,666 --> 01:45:56,082
Heinzi,

1599
01:45:56,666 --> 01:46:00,416
<i>Are you coming with me for a bike ride?
-Oh, I promise you, come on.</i>

1600
01:46:01,457 --> 01:46:02,873
Heinzi.

1601
01:46:03,166 --> 01:46:04,999
(Peter laughs.)

1602
01:46:07,666 --> 01:46:09,207
My Heinzi.

1603
01:46:09,874 --> 01:46:11,499
My little Heinz.

1604
01:46:12,041 --> 01:46:13,666
Dad.

1605
01:46:16,916 --> 01:46:20,332
Mavie. What are you doing here?
-What are you all doing here?

1606
01:46:25,832 --> 01:46:27,415
(Heinz) Ha!

1607
01:46:27,582 --> 01:46:29,040
(Peter) Hammer!

1608
01:46:29,374 --> 01:46:31,707
(Piano music from inside)

1609
01:46:32,207 --> 01:46:34,582
I, I… I’ll leave you alone now.

1610
01:46:35,249 --> 01:46:38,749
Do you want to come in for a moment?
-No, no, everything's fine.

1611
01:46:38,916 --> 01:46:41,791
And we're riding bikes, Heinzi.

1612
01:46:42,332 --> 01:46:43,915
We’ll see each other!

1613
01:46:44,999 --> 01:46:47,249
(Soft music)

1614
01:46:58,957 --> 01:47:02,248
(Music stops.)
-I can’t remember the rest quite as well.

1615
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:04,457
(Georg) Great, Leni. Great.

1616
01:47:06,999 --> 01:47:11,040
Almost as good as Hilmal.
-(Georg) What a beautiful ending.

1617
01:47:11,374 --> 01:47:15,165
But it’s already late, I’m going now.
-You can sleep here.

1618
01:47:15,499 --> 01:47:18,332
Yes.
-So… thank you, you're very welcome, yes.

1619
01:47:19,291 --> 01:47:22,541
Leni, you say, I don’t
want to change anything.

1620
01:47:22,874 --> 01:47:24,457
Look.

1621
01:47:24,874 --> 01:47:29,290
My driver’s license. I don’t think
that will save the climate, but…

1622
01:47:29,457 --> 01:47:31,832
Maybe a few pedestrians.
-Yes.

1623
01:47:32,166 --> 01:47:34,541
That expired a long time ago.
-Really?

1624
01:47:34,874 --> 01:47:37,249
(Heinz) Look who's here.

1625
01:47:37,707 --> 01:47:38,707
Hello!

1626
01:47:39,416 --> 01:47:41,374
No.
-(Leni cheers.)

1627
01:47:42,249 --> 01:47:44,749
(Mavie) Hello.
-(Carla) My darling!

1628
01:47:45,332 --> 01:47:47,373
Oops!

1629
01:47:47,707 --> 01:47:50,123
(A joyful babble of voices)

1630
01:47:51,666 --> 01:47:53,124
(Johlen)

1631
01:47:56,874 --> 01:47:59,832
(Music: "Let's Dance"
by David Bowie)

1632
01:48:05,874 --> 01:48:07,707
(Cheers)

1633
01:48:21,749 --> 01:48:23,874
(Song) Let's Dance

1634
01:48:30,582 --> 01:48:32,582
Let's Dance

1635
01:48:38,874 --> 01:48:40,957
Let's Dance

1636
01:48:41,416 --> 01:48:43,666
Put on your red shoes.

1637
01:48:43,999 --> 01:48:45,999
And dance the blues.

1638
01:48:47,832 --> 01:48:50,165
Let's Dance to the song.

1639
01:48:50,499 --> 01:48:53,415
They're playin' on the radio

1640
01:48:55,249 --> 01:48:56,707
Let's Dance

1641
01:48:57,582 --> 01:49:01,165
While colour lights up your face

1642
01:49:03,999 --> 01:49:05,457
Let's Dance

1643
01:49:06,499 --> 01:49:09,707
Sway through the
crowd to an empty space

1644
01:49:10,916 --> 01:49:12,749
(Birds are chirping.)

1645
01:49:13,957 --> 01:49:15,790
(Phone buzzes.)

1646
01:49:27,791 --> 01:49:28,999
Healthy.

1647
01:49:29,332 --> 01:49:32,623
Tomorrow, Heinz. Just wanted
to ask: Are you still coming?

1648
01:49:34,291 --> 01:49:36,332
I'm taking off today...

1649
01:49:36,666 --> 01:49:38,499
Is that okay?
-Sure.
