*Tortured Muttering*

<font color="#ffff00">or I have missed my</font>
<font="#ffff00">career advancement.)</font>

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.920
<font color="#ffff00">(As they say, there are days when </font>
<font="#ffff00">it would be better to have stayed in bed.)</font>

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.320
* Mysterious Sounds *

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.520
<font color="#ffff00">Hello?</font>

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.440
* Unsettled Sounds *

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000

*Theme music by
"Philip Maloney"*

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.880
(Announcer) The hair-raising
cases of Philip Maloney.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.759
Today: Killer Instinct

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.079
<font color="#ffffff">With subtitles by SWISS TXT</font>

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.760
Maloney?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.400
<font color="#ffff00">He was missing just now.</font>
- That's a crime scene.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.680
<font color="#ffff00">I was all out of cheese.</font>
 - What are you doing here?

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.760
<font color="#ffff00">Personal protection.</font>

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.079
They say: Target missed. <font color="#ffff00">- That's not my client.</font>

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.200
Come with me. What
about the second body?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.280
<font color="#ffff00">Which second body?</font>

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.600
The cleaner has
reported two bodies.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.240
One here and one under a desk

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.800
in Mr. Tosoni's office -
they say she looks awful.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.800
<font color="#ffff00">There I was lying.</font>

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.320
The corpse had a
bloody knife in its hand.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.760
Where is the knife, Maloney?

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.600
<font color="#ffff00">There are no fingerprints </font>
<font color="#ffff00">on it anymore.</font>

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.840
Finally, it's time...

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.440
<font color="#ffff00">What? Are you retiring?</font>
- You are under arrest, Maloney.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.520
That's so good,
just one more time:

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.160
You are under arrest, right now. 
<font color="#ffff00">- Are you serious?</font>

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.320
Resistance is futile!
Maloney, you are under arrest.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.960
No, no, the other way
around sounds even better.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.640
You are under arrest,
Maloney. You are under arrest!

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.040
<font color="#ffff00">I have never seen him
so happy.</font>

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.840
<font color="#ffff00">Just for the record:</font>
<font="#ffff00">You are wasting taxpayers' money.</font>

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.600
We are still a long
way from the protocol.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.880
Enjoy the here and now.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.400
<font color="#ffff00">I don't like it,</font>
<font="#ffff00">when he is so happy.</font>

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.480
Come in.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.320
*Merry Whistling*

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.600
I would have liked to
keep you waiting longer,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.079
but duty calls.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.640
<font color="#ffff00">Is that a new preference?</font>

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.760
No, I'm just protecting myself
from a potential murderer.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.640
<font color="#ffff00">And who protects me</font>
<font="#ffff00">from potential idiots?</font>

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.000
It is important, that you say 
everything into the microphone.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.520
<font color="#ffff00">Who protects me</font>
<font="#ffff00">from potential idiots?</font>

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.120
Everything you say,
will be transcribed,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.200
analyzed and cataloged.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.320
If you are guilty,
our system knows.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.800
even before you
admitted anything.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.120
The future of the
police is efficient.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.560
<font color="#ffff00">And the future of mankind</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is lost.</font>

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.600
Also, Maloney.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.680
Last name, first name?

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.120
No, for the record.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.840
<font color="#ffff00">Philip Maloney, innocent.</font>

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.280
Innocent people don't
wake up with a bloody knife.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.920
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't kill the woman.</font>
- That's what they all say.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.440
<font color="#ffff00">I have no motive.</font>
- A motive is always found.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.720
The deceased's name is Tabea
Schuppisser. She was a chance ...

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.600
No, wrong, Change
and Innovation Manager

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.760
at Tosoni Lebensmittel AG.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.920
Does that tell you something? 
<font color="#ffff00">- What? Tabea Schuppisser?</font>

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.640
<font color="#ffff00">Or Change</font>
<font color="#ffffff">and Innovation Management? - Both.</font>

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.800
<font color="#ffff00">A little.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah, what now?- Both.</font>

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.159
Why do you always have
to rename everything?

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.960
Next, it's no longer called
Police, but Crime Management.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Crime ...

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.120
... Management.
No, that's it, I'm done!

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.920
Maloney, You're
telling me exactly now,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.880
What happened last night. And
don't leave anything out, understood?

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.960
<font color="#ffff00">Also ...</font>

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.040
<font color="#ffff00">Started</font>
<font="#ffff00">it actually like always.</font>

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.120
<font color="#ffff00">In my office.</font>

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.160
<font color="#ffff00">With a commission.</font>

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.040
Tosoni is my name, Daniel Tosoni.
I am being pursued by a killer.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.240
<font color="#ffff00">I see no killer.</font>

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.160
With jokes you're at the
wrong address with me.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.760
Humor is for people
without ambitions.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.200
<font color="#ffff00">You're at the wrong door.</font>
- But someone wants to kill me.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.520
<font color="#ffff00">Where do you want to know that from?</font>
 - That's my killer instinct.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.280
<font color="#ffff00">Does he also tell you</font>
<font="#ffff00">who wants to kill you?</font>

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.200
Unfortunately no. I am a
successful entrepreneur.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.480
Since I took over the
company from my mother,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.560
is that growth enormous -
that's how you make enemies.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.320
<font color="#ffff00">Company, growth and mother</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in one sentence.</font>

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.680
<font color="#ffff00">No wonder,</font>
<font="#ffff00">someone wants to kill him.</font>

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.880
Accompany me to the
company anniversary.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.880
<font color="#ffff00">I am a private investigator, not an escort.</font>
- As a bodyguard.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.480
You must constantly expand your scope of work.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.800
Only then will you
remain competitive.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.080
<font color="#ffff00">Exactly those people</font>
<font="#ffff00">are to blame for that,</font>

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.680
<font color="#ffff00">that those above have increasingly more </font>
<font="#ffff00">and those below increasingly less.</font>

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.680
<font color="#ffff00">But if it helps with redistribution,</font>
<font="#ffff00">I can't object too much either.</font>

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.080
<font color="#ffff00">You're in luck: As of today</font>
<font="#ffff00">I also offer personal protection,</font>

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.480
<font color="#ffff00">however, at a higher price -</font>
<font color="#ffff00">hazard pay.</font>

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.440
<font color="#ffff00">So is good.</font>

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.400
* Loose Music *

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.560
<font color="#ffff00">(Tosoni introduced me </font>
<font="#ffff00">at this party as his employee</font>

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.800
<font color="#ffff00">introduced as an investor</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and I hoped,</font>

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.480
<font color="#ffff00">not to meet any more of his kind</font>
<font color="#ffff00">.)</font>

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.880
That's Tabea
Schuppisser, by the way.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.200
Listen to them carefully,
then you can learn something.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.800
... for this reason I have
developed an action plan.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.320
If you apply the plan
correctly, Tosoni Food Ltd. will

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.520
soon be set up
even more agilely.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.240
The Schuppisser Strategy!
- The Future of Cheese!

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.200
Exactly. Be there on time
for the company anniversary.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.520
A restructuring plan, that
will make us competitive

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.320
will provide a clear
advantage. Voila!

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.720
Yes!

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.720
My mother knew, of
course, how to make cheese,

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.200
but she didn't understand
anything about numbers.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.000
We have to make our
cheese attractive to investors.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.360
<font color="#ffff00">You have to kind of pull the strings with that cheese.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Exactly.</font>

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.240
(Schuppisser) The management of a 
company must be based on figures.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.800
Emotions are irrelevant
in modern economics.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.720
Daniel fortunately
understands and lets us work.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.799
Thank you, Daniel.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.480
Marlon Andermatt, Head of
Communications and Public Relations.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:46.080
I am responsible for the
communications strategy

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
and for the stakeholders.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.600
<font color="#ffff00">Good, when you look at the steaks.</font>
- No steak. Marketing.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.040
Because of me, people buy
all that cheese in the first place.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.280
You certainly know our slogan. 
<font color="#ffff00">- Luckily not yet.</font>

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.440
"Tosoni - the one and only." 
That was my idea.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.280
Products and companies
need emotions and storytelling.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.560
A slogan needs power!

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.200
Where is your investment focus?

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.560
<font color="#ffff00">On the tobacco and whiskey industry.</font>
- A dying branch.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.000
You should reorient yourself. 
<font color="#ffff00">- Cheese and more cheese?</font>

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.680
My Tabea. She has
a knack for the future.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.760
We are a couple.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.960
<font color="#ffff00">One should not mix</font>
<font="#ffff00">private and professional matters.</font>

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.560
I see this separation as
an artifact of bygone times.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.440
Tabea has written an
exciting thesis on this.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.400
<font color="#ffff00">I can imagine that.</font>
 - Increased productivity

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.000
through the synergy of
professional and private life.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.080
Do you want to raise them?

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.760
<font color="#ffff00">I'd rather stick </font>
<font="#ffff00">cheese in my ears.</font>

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.400
That's a party, not a meeting.
Come on, have fun! Come with me.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.160
The Schuppisser strategy is highly
sought after by my competition.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.960
A groundbreaking plan
for our entire industry.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.440
I'd better get them to safety.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.960
* Threatening Sounds *

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.200
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you, I'm
already taken care of.</font>

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.640
Haven't you heard, Fink?
He doesn't want any cheese.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.480
No appreciation for
tradition and cheese?

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.360
Have you seen the
knife? Fink is a killer.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.680
He tried several
times to start a union.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.680
I want to pass on my
entrepreneurial spirit to my employees.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.600
That's not always easy,
but I always tell myself:

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.160
"Daniel, it's
lonely at the top."

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.040
Come with me.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
* Animated Music *

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.640
Are you the mysterious investor?
<font color="#ffff00">- They say so.</font>

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.280
Amanita Koller. I head
the Mycology Department.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.320
<font color="#ffff00">Myko-what?</font>
- Mycology. That's fungi.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.080
<font color="#ffff00">And what are you looking for</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in a cheese factory?</font>

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
I'm developing an alternative
product to cheese here.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.400
<font color="#ffff00">Instead of blue cheese</font>
<font="#ffff00">only blue mold anymore?</font>

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.120
Mushrooms also
have a cleansing effect.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200
Mycotherapy.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.800
Mushrooms are among
the oldest natural remedies.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.320
They detoxify the body and
strengthen the immune system.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.200
It's also good for the liver.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.280
<font color="#ffff00">If you say so.</font>

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.880
<font color="#ffff00">And what do you think</font>
<font="#ffff00">of the Schuppisser strategy?</font>

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.160
Tabea says, if
Tosoni doesn't resist,

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.240
then we're going
all in on mushrooms.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.280
In the plan there are funds
for a larger mushroom lab.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.080
<font color="#ffff00">But Tosoni isn't interested?</font>
- We'll see about that.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.760
Do you know, I have a weakness

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.560
for morbid and
idiosyncratic life forms.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.640
<font color="#ffff00">Aha.</font>

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.960
Do you dance?

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.040
<font color="#ffff00">Only if there's no other way.</font>

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.120
Too bad.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.880
* Animated Pop Music *

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.320
(Tosoni) Maloney!

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.640
<font color="#ffff00">Oh my.</font>
<font="#ffff00">I almost forgot that one.</font>

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.680
With your work ethic I would
have gone bankrupt a long time ago.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.320
<font color="#ffff00">Turnover is just a state too.</font>
- You sound like my mother.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.240
Yes, watch my badge.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.360
If something happens to me,
the Schuppisser strategy is safe.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.920
* Mysterious Sounds *

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.680
Cheese!

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.440
Cheese!

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.520
Get up!

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.960
Morning hour has
cheese in its mouth.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.280
<font color="#ffff00">And you have</font>
<font="#ffff00">an Emmental in your head.</font>

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.160
<font color="#ffff00">A leaky brain</font>
<font="#ffff00">with an expired date.</font>

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.600
Better a young cheese in your
head than an old Maloney in the box.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.320
While you were lounging around here,
the police were busy.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.680
<font color="#ffff00">And, what have you found out?</font>

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.640
It's all very complex
and mixed up.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.000
<font color="#ffff00">And now you need</font>
<font="#ffff00">a Maloney to straighten things out?</font>

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.080
Don't think you're off the hook.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.120
You report to me every 3 hours. 
<font color="#ffffff">- But...- Every 3 hours!</font>

<font color="#ffff00">(One shouldn't think,</font>
<font="#ffff00">that one could give a Maloney</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Just calm down.</font>

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.720
Maloney, you've got guts.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.000
That's all your fault. 
<font color="#ffff00">- What?</font>

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.840
The Schuppisser
strategy, it is gone.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.240
The whole file!
Simply gone, stolen.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.840
You want to finish off my
company and me But not with me!

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.480
<font color="#ffff00">Put the thing away.</font>
- You have to kill a killer!

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.560
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe you're the killer.</font>

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.840
I won't pay you
for suspecting me.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.280
If you keep this up, I
won't pay you anymore.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.640
<font color="#ffff00">Ms. Schuppisser has offered you </font>
<font="#ffff00">the top position at the company</font>

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.640
<font color="#ffff00">Contested.</font>

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.720
What? *He laughs.*

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.440
Certainly not.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.840
Aren't you listening?
The plan is gone!

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.960
Someone's after me.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.840
<font color="#ffff00">Nevertheless, Mrs. Schuppisser is dead</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and not you.</font>

Hey, where are you going?

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.000
Where are you going?

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.440

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.080
<font color="#ffff00">(And it is, as in most</font>
<font="#ffff00">cases, a personal motive.)</font>

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.320
She is dead. She's
out of her mind.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.960
She takes the boat.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.720
Tabea, my Tabea. 
<font color="#ffff00">- Why are you working today?</font>

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.600
What else should I do?

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.200
Someone must write the obituary.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.240
This is my home.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.800
<font color="#ffff00">Increased productivity</font>

<font="#ffff00">of professional and private live?</font>

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.040
Exactly.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.520
<font color="#ffff00">And eventually</font>
<font="#ffff00">it's just all too much.</font>

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:15.200
You can't just run off.
I need you, Maloney!

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.040
<font color="#ffff00">And I can't use you right now</font>
<font color="#ffff00">at all.</font>

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.800
Did Marlon steal the plan?

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.079
What are you still doing here?

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.560
You are not an investor. 
<font color="#ffff00">- Private detective.</font>

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.640
You've put a snitch on us?

Not without reason! 
<font color="#ffff00">- Now put the weapon down!</font>

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.960
<font color="#ffff00">Mrs. Schuppisser</font>

<font color="#ffff00">from the mushroom department.</font>
<font="#ffff00">Did she want to leave you?</font>

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.800
Tabea and Amanita had an affair,
but it's not what you think.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.800
Tabea thought, our
relationship would benefit from it,

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.880
when we open them.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.960
And she was right.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.960
He's lying! Open relationships
don't work! You know that.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.400
Tell the truth!
 - That is the truth.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.840
I am your boss, you
must tell me the truth!

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.800
Okay, okay. I was
always a little jealous.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.680
Tabea promised me
yesterday evening,

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.800
to end this with Amanita.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.480
I find, that sounds
all very suspicious.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.240
<font color="#ffff00">I think</font>
<font="#ffff00">you both sound very suspicious.</font>

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.920
What is that?

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.760
"Tabea, you wanted to
fly - now you are dead."

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.840
Is that all?
- What?

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.760
Isn't this finished yet? 
This is awful.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.160
First attempts are never
perfect, but I expect more.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.040
We did talk about it, didn't we?

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.760
Make two more suggestions 
by this afternoon.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.160
That's enough, you asshole...
- Don't talk to me like that!

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.720
No, you don't speak to me like that!
 - I expect to be spoken to with proper respect!

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.960
<font color="#ffff00">(There was one other person, </font>
<font="#ffff00">who dipped into the fondue.)</font>

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.000
<font color="#ffff00">(Let's see, where she is </font>
<font color="#ffff00">emotionally at the moment.)</font>

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.680
Yes, exactly.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.120
She ended our relationship,
but that's not so bad.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.800
Mushrooms scatter their
spores in all directions

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.920
and form symbioses
with various plants.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Exactly like me.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.920
<font color="#ffff00">What happened last night?</font>
- You can't remember anything?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.480
<font color="#ffff00">Perhaps, because you drugged me.</font>

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.560
Mycotherapy is healthy.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.040
I can't explain your
extreme reaction either.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.560
As if your body had
resisted a cleansing.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.920
There you are.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.120
Homeland, it's damp in here. Has
she confessed to the murder yet?

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.000
What?
 - You wanted a bigger lab,

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.160
but Tabea didn't
want to give it to you.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.120
Mushrooms have a future.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.880
Mushrooms have despite
sustainable investment

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.200
no yield-technical benefit.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.280
Tabea knew that,
she never told you that.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.000
People like you have no future!

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.200
<font color="#ffff00">Someone is looking for a fight.</font>
- What did you say?

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.640
Her mother would turn
over in her grave if she saw,

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.160
how you run the company and
how tasteless the products are.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.720
If the customer
wants to eat sawdust,

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.360
I sell you sawdust.
That's how easy it is.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.080
That's enough. I quit!

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.080
Super! Problem solved.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.680
I think it's great too, my
problem is also solved.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.760
Is that poisonous?

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.360
Ugh, that's disgusting!

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:36.120
<font color="#ffff00">The case would be much simpler if</font>
<font="#ffff00">Mr. Tosoni were truly the victim.</font>

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.080
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Tosoni, what is the</font>
<font="#ffff00">Schuppisser strategy anyway?</font>

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.640
I never quite understood that.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.400
But Tabea said it
needed structural changes.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.760
Someone should have been fired. 
<font color="#ffff00">- If that isn't a motive. Who?</font>

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.800
I had no opportunity,
to look at the plan.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.600
<font color="#ffff00">Let's assume you were the boss.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Who would you fire?</font>

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.160
I am the boss. 
<font color="#ffff00">- Yes.</font>

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.400
The Cheesemaker. Benjamin Fink.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.200
The murder weapon
was a cheese knife.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.280
That's no coincidence. Why
does all this have to happen to me?

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.680
Hey, that's not the
dairy. Hey, hey! Maloney!

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.280
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Fink?</font>

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.960
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Fink!</font>

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.440

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.480
<font color="#ffff00">Hello?</font>

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.920
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Fink?</font>

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.080
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Fink!</font>

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.960
What's wrong?

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.600
<font color="#ffff00">What is that noise?</font>
- I'm just singing.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.680
<font color="#ffff00">That's a steep thesis.</font>

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.080
<font color="#ffff00">Is it true that Mrs. Schuppisser</font>
<font color="#ffff00">wanted to fire you?</font>

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.440
No. 
<font color="#ffff00">- Are you sure?</font>

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.760
<font color="#ffff00">What about the murder weapon?</font>

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.520
It's a shame to dirty such
a beautiful cheese knife.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.120
<font color="#ffff00">Good Lord. And anything else?</font>

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.520
<font color="#ffff00">Did you see anything?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Hear anything?</font>

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.600
<font color="#ffff00">Have you murdered someone?</font>

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.720
I saw you go into
Tosoni's office.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
And you weren't alone.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.880
<font color="#ffff00">Not alone?</font>

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.240
<font color="#ffff00">(I was tired of only being
told half the truth.)</font>

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.480
<font color="#ffff00">(So I did what I always do in such a case:</font>

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.560
<font color="#ffff00">a short break.)</font>

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.120
The plan is gone.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.720
The killer could come
in at any moment

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.880
and I've misplaced my weapon.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.960
And what are you doing?
Taking a power nap?

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.400
<font color="#ffff00">Sometimes</font>
<font="#ffff00">you have to give the truth time,</font>

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.800
<font color="#ffff00">then it will appear on its own.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to light.</font>

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.200
What did I even
hire you for?

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.680
What do you want?

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.840
Actually nothing.
- Alright then, let's continue working.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.400
After my mother's death, all
the competing companies wanted

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.760
to shut down the company.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.120
But I won't let them take it away
from me - neither then nor now.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.520
A restructuring I can
also manage alone.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.600
* Mysterious Sounds *

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.040
* Enticing music *

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.600
<font color="#ffff00">(I would never have thought in my life,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that I would ever say that.)</font>

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.800
<font color="#ffff00">Luckily I have a </font>
<font="#ffff00">phone appointment with the police.</font>

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.960
<font color="#ffff00">Did you want to disappear with the Schuppisser-</font>
<font color="#ffff00">strategy?</font>

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.560
You stole them. Did you
sell them to the competition?

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.640
She's not interested.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.480
I just wanted to see if I
could finally expand my lab.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.560
Ha, look! 
<font color="#ffff00">- Quiet!</font>

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.480
<font color="#ffff00">Did you want to go to the party</font>
<font="#ffff00">with me in Mr. Tosoni's office?</font>

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.360
That was a win-win situation.
<font color="#ffff00">- What's in it?</font>

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.760
I always thought that Tosoni
was against my mushrooms.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:05.040
Moreover, Tabea was against my lab. 
<font color="#ffff00">- That's why you killed her?</font>

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.600
No, certainly not. I would
never do anything like that!

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.800
And where is the plan now?

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.320
There, where it
belongs: in the trash can.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.520
<font color="#ffff00">The plan states</font>
<font="#ffff00">who was to be fired.</font>

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.920
<font color="#ffff00">And that is a motive for murder.</font>

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.560
I haven't looked at the
Schuppisser- strategy that closely.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.640
Maybe she's still there.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.320
Here, here she is.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.280
I've got it, the
Schuppisser strategy!

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.040
<font color="#ffff00">\"Vision understanding,</font>
<font="#ffff00">top down, bottom up ..."</font>

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.760
<font color="#ffff00">Numbers, numbers, numbers,</font>
<font="#ffff00">Agile, agile, agile.</font>

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.560
<font color="#ffff00">Ah. "Within the framework of the current</font>
<font color="#ffff00">restructuring measures"</font>

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.600
<font color="#ffff00">it is unfortunately necessary,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a certain place</font>

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.400
<font color="#ffff00">to eliminate within the company</font>
<font color="#ffff00">.</font>

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.880
<font color="#ffff00">"This concerns
the position of..."</font>

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.960
Give me the plan!

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.240
He has my weapon.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.240
Marlon. You killed Tabea?

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.920
<font color="#ffff00">Ms. Schuppisser did not want him</font>
<font="#ffff00">neither privately nor professionally</font>

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.920
<font color="#ffff00">to continue to be busy with it.</font>
- She wanted to get rid of me.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.080
And I brought her into the
company. And into my life.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.760
Her career was
always all that mattered.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.560
Then she fired me and left.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.120
Everything was taken from
me. And now I stand here.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.480
I, "Tosoni - the one and only".
What would the company be without the slogan?

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.960
<font color="#ffff00">A Company</font>
<font="#ffff00">with a better slogan.</font>

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.400
<font color="#ffff00">That's why you killed her</font>
<font="#ffff00">and tried to frame me?</font>

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.160
I wanted to destroy the plan.
They were lying there half dead.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.640
<font color="#ffff00">That was just camouflage.</font>
 - (Tosoni) Ha!

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.280
I thought the whole
time, a killer was after me.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.400
It was just Marlon.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.720
Thanks to my slogan everyone
knows the company Tosoni.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.600
Don't be silly.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.160
Weapons in the air and
head behind the hands!

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.960
Ah.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.640
You've already got him packed.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.800
So.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.720
The killer has been caught.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.640
I survived the killer.
 - Mr. Andermatt is no killer.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.680
He killed his partner because
 she wanted to leave him.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.280
That's why I don't
work with my wife.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.760
Is your wife also a policewoman?
- No, but theoretically.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.960
<font color="#ffff00">Theoretically</font>
<font="#ffff00">you could also be a police officer.</font>

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.040
Madness.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.080
I survived a killer.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.760
Nothing can stop me.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.280
I no longer need
you, you are fired.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.440
Now I'm going to make a global
corporation out of this company!

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.360
<font color="#ffff00">If I'm not careful,</font>
<font="#ffff00">Tosoni will overheat me again.</font>

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.600
<font color="#ffff00">Come in.</font>

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.840
No, no, no. 
<font color="#ffff00">- Cool it.</font>

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.800
Hey, hey! That's my company!

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.880
Let me out!

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.400
Maloney!

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.560
It's just a graze. I have just
the right thing for the wound.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.320
If I had known that
it would relieve you,

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.240
then I would have naturally
not thrown away the plan.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.720
<font color="#ffff00">Now, since I was in</font>
<font color="#ffff00"> prison because of you,</font>

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.600
<font color="#ffff00">Could we go and collect some foot fungi
in the indoor pool together?</font>

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.640
I have a weakness for
mushrooms. Not for burrs.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.840
* Mysterious Sounds *

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.600
