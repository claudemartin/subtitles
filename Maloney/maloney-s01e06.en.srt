1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
* Snoring. *

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
*Phone rings*

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
*Phone rings*

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
*Phone ringing*

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes?
- (Woman) Mr. Maloney?

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Mr. Maloney, I need your help.
- That's what everyone says.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Please. My name is Alder.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I work at the Bel
Etage luxury clinic.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My colleague,
Mr. Rossmann, was murdered.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Who says that?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The police say it was
suicide, but that's not true.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Luxury clinic, you say?
- I’ve organized everything.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You are expected in one
hour under the name Maroni.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Marroni isn't
obvious, is he? or?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Trust no one. I'll
come to you at 10 PM.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Then I'll tell you more.
- Tell me more now.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
She hangs up.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Title music by "Philip Maloney"

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Hair-Raising
Cases of Philip Maloney.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Today: "The Clinic".

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
With subtitles by SWISS TXT

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So you are Mr. Maroni?

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That is what people tell me.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What do you hope to gain
from a stay in our clinic?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I hear a voice.
- What is this voice telling you?

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That I shouldn't trust anyone.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They think everyone is hiding
something and that only you know the truth.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you feel lonely?
- Unfortunately not at the moment.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Do you not answer truthfully,

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
...because you are afraid,
it would rip apart your reality?

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
At the moment, my patience
is wearing rather thin.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You have built a very
strong wall, Mr. Maroni,

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
that protects you,
but also locks you in.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Where are you now
with your thoughts?

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Here.
- I feel your pain.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And I feel your loneliness too.
But everything will be alright.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I can help you. Here
we treat body and mind.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Then...

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You don't always have to
say something, Mr. Maroni.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Just listen and open
yourself up, okay?

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes, we have a lot, a
lot of work ahead of us.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Restless sounds.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Tomorrow your therapy begins.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you enjoy working here?

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why?

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Are the working conditions good,

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
or do you want to
jump off the roof?

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Mr. Rossmann had
personal problems.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And you? Do you
want to talk about it?

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Good night.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
(My client, Mrs. Alder,
doesn't arrive until 10 p.m.)

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I did what I always
do in such situations:

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't lose your mind. And wait.)

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
*To tick*

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Strange.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
(If the client doesn’t
come to the detective,

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
(I guess the detective
has to go to the client.)

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Uncomfortable sounds.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Mrs. Alder?

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Mrs. Alder?

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Steps.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Have you come to help me?

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you Mrs. Alder?
- Mrs. Weber.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Then not.
- You are one of them too.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I am not crazy.
- I never claimed that.

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I am only here because of my
father. He has money. I am not crazy.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If she continues like this, I won’t
believe a word she says anymore.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You won't get out of here.
- Hm.

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
(This clinic is a
strange place.)

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
(Mrs. Alder didn't show up,
instead a Mrs. Weber did.)

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
(Mr. Rossmann is dead,

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Mrs. Alder says,
it wasn't suicide.)

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
(And she hasn't shown up.)

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
(Mann) Good morning.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I am the head of the clinic, I
would like to give you a tour.

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Is Mrs. Alder working today?
- Mrs. Alder?

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
As far as I know, we don't
have a Frau Alder here.

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Are you sure?

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
As head of the clinic, one
knows one’s employees.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Tell me.

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Do you have any other questions?
- Do you lock up your patients?

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Do you feel trapped?
- A little bit, yes.

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mr. Maroni, I always
say: Don't worry.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Do yoga. Feel free.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
*Ringing*

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Ah.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Ah.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I’ll take care of that
for you, Mr. Müller.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You are doing excellent work.
- Thank you.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You can’t trust anyone anymore.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So the gentleman isn’t
the head of the clinic?

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Come in. Yoga is about to begin.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Soft sounds.

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Have you found the exit yet?
- Do we know each other?

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yesterday night.
- Why are you speaking to me?

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That won't work!
- Mrs. Weber, Mrs. Weber.

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Deep breath, just
like we practiced.

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let me.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
(Various) Om.

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Please stand up?

101
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Smoking is unfortunately
prohibited here, excuse me.

102
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Apology accepted.

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Break away from your addiction.

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Give me the cigarette.

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Join in, it will do you good.

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Then you see clearly again,
the voices in your head disappear.

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Breathe in.

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And exhale.

109
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Concentrate on the essentials.

110
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes.
- Breathe in.

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Breathe out.

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Do you miss anyone?
- No.

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Look, over there in the bush.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes…

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh.

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That is not good
at all for our clinic.

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What will the
police think of me?

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
No fear. They only think they
are police officers themselves.

119
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Maloney. Have you
finally turned yourself in?

120
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I am undercover here.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Do what you want. I'm looking
for the hospital administration.

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
How can I help?
- You have a corpse in the bushes.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I know that’s not ideal.
Should I release a statement?

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, gladly.
- On behalf of the clinic,

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the sponsors, and also
personally from me…

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Alright, I’ll take
care of it, Mr. Müller.

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Good day. 
Who is in charge now?

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Me.

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Me.

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Her.

131
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You have a
corpse in the bushes.

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Are you sure,
that it’s a corpse?

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes, what else could it be?
- Tell me.

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What? No, no, certainly not. 
Tell me.

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Fascinating. I would like to
do a psychoanalysis with you.

136
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No, no psychoanalysis.

137
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I ask the questions here
and you answer. Yes?

138
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes, but without my lawyers, I’m
afraid I’m not answering any questions.

139
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
My lords and ladies. Off
to Aqua Fit! Hop, hop, hop.

140
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Maloney. There's a corpse in the bush.
- May I guess? Female.

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
There are only two possibilities.
- I've heard different.

142
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Does she have a name too?
- Yes, we assume so.

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm betting on Alder.
- Another one of your clients?

144
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Mrs. Alder has hired me,

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
because Rossman's death
seemed suspicious to her.

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Rossmann, Rossmann,
suicide… This case is closed.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Are you sure?
- He jumped off the roof.

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Ah, Maloney, we must be careful.

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
This directive comes
from the very top.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Do you have any fear?
- Ah, papperlapapp. Maloney!

151
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Are you the presiding officer?
- Yes, indeed.

152
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We represent the clinic.
- What is he doing here?

153
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Always the same: unmasking
murderers. How's the young one doing?

154
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We represent the Bel Etage
Clinic, including patients and staff.

155
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Also me?
- Yes, you too, Mr. Maroni.

156
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Nasty business, Maroni.

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Giggle

158
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We are in a very
sensitive environment.

159
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We expect the highest
level of discretion.

160
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Your presence creates unrest.

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Think of the patients.
- And female patients.

162
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
(While the police officer and the Schimpfs
were thinking about the patients,

163
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I couldn’t stop thinking
about the clinic director.)

164
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hello?

165
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
May I keep you company?

166
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
They don't hear any voices at all.
- Not at the moment.

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I also need one.
For body and soul.

168
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You can definitely manage
that. I noticed you right away.

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You lack that innate
arrogance of the wealthy.

170
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I take that as a compliment.
- Who are you?

171
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Philip Maloney,
private detective.

172
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Mrs. Alder hired you, I presume.

173
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
She hadn’t understood
Mr. Rossmann’s suicide.

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But she lived in
her own reality.

175
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And now she’s lying
dead there in that bush.

176
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes, because she loved the bush.

177
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You have no idea how many
people kill themselves. Unfortunately.

178
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And Mr. Rossmann
jumped down here?

179
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yes.

180
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
One doesn't die, if one
jumps down from here.

181
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Did you want to say something?

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
One doesn't die, if one
jumps down from here.

183
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
One dies faster than one
thinks. Shall I discharge you now?

184
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Or are you staying
a little longer?

185
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I still need more help
for body and spirit.

186
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Well, whatever.

187
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But please adhere to
the rules of the clinic.

188
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Uncomfortable sounds.

189
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The Weber family left the clinic 
after the death of Rossmann ...

190
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
a large sum of money. 
I wonder why?

191
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Have you gotten
lost, Mr. Maroni?

192
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm looking for the party basement,
but it's so dark everywhere.

193
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I will help you. No problem.

194
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Distorted sounds
Everything is fine.

195
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Everything is fine, Mr. Maroni.

196
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You are in the
best hands with us.

197
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Om..

198
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Ah.

199
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
* Distorted sounds. *

200
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We are watching over you.

201
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
*Ringing*

202
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Thank you, I am served.

203
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh. Now you did really well.

204
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes, but this stuff is
getting to me the wrong way.

205
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We must tell Mrs. Näf.

206
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
No.
- Come here.

207
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Mr. Maroni would
like to say something.

208
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I would like to be
discharged as healed.

209
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I’m afraid I can’t support that.

210
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Since Mr. Maroni imagines
himself, to be a private detective,

211
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
... unfortunately, I can’t release him.
- There’s only one thing left to do.

212
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Run.

213
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Ah.

214
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But I'm not tired at all.

215
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Psst.

216
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
*Distorted sounds.*

217
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
* Knocking*

218
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Maloney! *Groaning*

219
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
*Knocking.*

220
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
At the window!

221
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
*Knocking*

222
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I think I’m hallucinating.

223
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Now I can already see
flying police officers.

224
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You look terrible.

225
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Now even the
hallucination is insulting me.

226
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Mrs. Alder had taken
an overdose of sedatives.

227
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Tranquilizers? Here?

228
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
They were probably right
about Stockmann’s suicide.

229
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Um, Rossmann.
- I’m really hallucinating now.

230
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We have the corpse of
Rossmann once again exmi... exmu...

231
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
...exmatriculated and a huge
stick... stab wound found.

232
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So, not fallen from the roof?
- Yes, but he was already dead before that.

233
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The world has a
sunstroke, Maloney.

234
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Why don't you raid the
clinic and arrest everyone?

235
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Because of the Schimpfs. You are
obstructing all investigations.

236
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I need proof, Maloney.

237
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Neither my body nor my
mind are made for therapy.

238
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I have to get out of here.
- You must stay here.

239
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You must question patients.
- No.

240
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
They must have noticed something. 
Don’t fall asleep!

241
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes. Good.
- Maloney!

242
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Maloney!

243
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
*Ringing*

244
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm already full. Not as
full as Mrs. Alder, but ...

245
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Excuse me?
- I am not a patient.

246
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Mrs. Alder has hired
me as a private detective,

247
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
because Rossmann's death
seemed suspicious to her.

248
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And now she is dead too.

249
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Are you really a private detective?
- Mhm.

250
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Did you know, that the
Weber family ...

251
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
after Rossmann’s death, has transferred 
a lot of money to this clinic?

252
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Hm.

253
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Have you figured that out?
- Exactly.

254
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But even private detectives
have to take their medication.

255
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Ah!
- So.

256
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So. Now you can relax
in the thermal baths.

257
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
(If I don’t get anywhere
with the real clinic director,

258
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I guess I’ll just have to try
my luck with the fake one.)

259
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
(One takes what one gets.)

260
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Mr. Maroni.

261
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
How can I help you?
- It’s kind of you to ask.

262
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That’s precisely what
distinguishes a good leader.

263
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That’s why I’m here.
- What do you mean?

264
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You must know, I am
here under a false name.

265
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I am actually called Maloney
and am also the head of the clinic.

266
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Isn't that right!

267
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I am here to observe you.
- Me?

268
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
How you resolved the incident
at Rossmann with Mrs. Alder.

269
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Highly professional.
- Thank you very much.

270
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Hearing that feels really good.

271
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I had already feared,
to have committed...

272
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
a terrible mistake,
when I hid Mrs. Alder...

273
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
in the bushes.
- You have done what?

274
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
When I found Frau Alder
dead in the basement,

275
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I told myself:
"Now is the time."

276
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
"Now you can take responsibility."

277
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So, you have found Mrs. Alder already dead?

278
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yes. As medical director,
I must ensure that,

279
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
... there are no corpses in the basement.
- Of course, you are right.

280
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Did you push
Mr. Rossmann off the roof?

281
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Unfortunately, no.

282
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I would have handled that
completely differently. Terrible.

283
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't know exactly,
what happened.

284
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Just that it really
traumatized Mrs. Weber.

285
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Mr. Müller, You have
helped me very much.

286
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Gladly, from colleague to
colleague. All the best for your clinic.

287
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
(It was time to get back
into my own skin.)

288
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Leave me alone!
- I'd like that.

289
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But you must help
me, to figure out,

290
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
what happened to Mr. Rossmann.
- Rossmann, the miserable one.

291
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
He locked me in here,
just like all the others.

292
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But he liked it. I wanted to leave.

293
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
He held me back. 
Said I belonged locked up.

294
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
He insulted me.

295
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Aha.

296
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You know, my family says, I
am behaving conspicuously.

297
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But in our family,
that’s not allowed.

298
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And what happened to Rossmann?
- I defended myself.

299
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You have …

300
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And, is there a murder weapon?

301
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
* Uncomfortable sounds. *

302
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Mrs. Näf has tidied up.

303
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Has she, um.

304
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I shouldn’t have told
Mrs. Alden anything.

305
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
She was always so kind to me.

306
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It is essential to know,

307
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
what the employees are hiding.

308
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Ah.

309
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Then I guess I’ll just
have to use force.

310
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Doesn't that hurt?

311
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Why don't you just
take my badge?

312
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You stay here

313
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and give me a sign, as
soon as Mrs. Näf appears.

314
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
(My body and mind couldn’t
concentrate on the search.)

315
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
(I need a cigarette.)

316
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
If she can hide cigarettes there, then
she can also hide the murder weapon.

317
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Voilà.

318
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What is the meaning
of this, Mr. Maloney?

319
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Mrs. Näf is here.
- Yes, thank you, I see it.

320
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Mrs. Weber told me everything.
They are holding her captive here.

321
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I am not holding anyone captive.
That's what the wealthy families do.

322
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
They are happy when they can
drop their spoiled brat(s) here.

323
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And then you thought to yourself,
you can also benefit from it.

324
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I earned the money too.

325
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And does Mrs.
Alder deserve to die?

326
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Nobody deserves to die,
but we must. Sooner or later.

327
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Aha.

328
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Aren’t you taking your
medication anymore?

329
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
They struck at body and soul.

330
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And you are, of course,
always the smartest in the room.

331
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Then you also know,
what happens next?

332
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yes, you are calling Demir.
- Yes.

333
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So sad. I believe, we would
have gotten along so well.

334
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yes…

335
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Demir, a patient has broken in.
He wants to do something to me.

336
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Please come quickly!

337
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Mrs. Näf?
- Oh, Demir.

338
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Mr. Maroni is a little confused.

339
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
He wanted to attack me. Quick!

340
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Demir...

341
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It is all good, Mrs. Näf.

342
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Mrs. Alder was a friend.

343
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
* relaxed sounds *

344
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I recommend locking me up.

345
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
In me there is so
much criminal energy.

346
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I wonder where she comes from.

347
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Maybe I have narcissistic
personality disorder?

348
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
My mom...
- That's enough now.

349
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You are under arrest.

350
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And?

351
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yes, you did that well.

352
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Bravo.

353
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Please, please!

354
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I stabbed
Mr. Rossmann, arrest me.

355
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
No, I can’t do that, Mrs. Weber.

356
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You are not legally sane.
- I am legally sane.

357
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You must arrest me.
In prison, I am free.

358
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay, if you absolutely
insist. Arrested.

359
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You must arrest me
too. I was an accomplice.

360
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Take responsibility.
- Fine.

361
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Arrested.

362
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
(Thanks to me, the police
have too many people to lock up.)

363
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
(And I am finally free.)

364
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
(It’s not exactly a Bel Etage.)

365
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
(But at least there is nobody
who wants to drug me here.)

366
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
(And you don't lose your mind so quickly.)

367
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
(That’s how it’s done.)

368
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
