00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
(Translated with gemma2)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
(A break from people and their
problems is desirable,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but one should be careful
with one's wishes.)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
One claims he is being watched by birds
in his garden.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
(I need clients again,
just to realize,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that they are crazy
and not me.)

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
They don't look good.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If I want to be offended, I'll go to the police.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Unlike the police,
I still deliver quality.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Are you always like this with your clients?
- When they get on my nerves.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
How can I help?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You won't believe me, but
I am being watched by birds.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I have a bird, after all.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Yes, you have a bird.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
* Rattle *

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Am I in the right place?
Maloney, private detective?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Hallelujah.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
* Theme music from "Philip Maloney" *

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The hair-raising cases
of Philip Maloney.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Today: "The Last Day".

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
With subtitles by SWISS TXT

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
If you need a father,&lt;br&gt;you're
at the wrong address.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
&lt;br&gt;I imagined a detective
agency&lt;br&gt;more respectable.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
&lt;br&gt;Then you have to go to the police.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
&lt;br&gt;I was already
there,&lt;br&gt;they can't help me.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
&lt;br&gt;Perhaps you&lt;br&gt;can't be helped anymore.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
&lt;br&gt;It's about my mother:&lt;br&gt;she got

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
caught in a cult and can't get out.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
They call themselves "The Last Day" and
practice in the forest for the end of the world.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Where else should they practice
the end of the world? - Nowhere!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I told her that the lunatics
only want their savings.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
She has always been
a strange bird,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
but now I'm afraid
that she's completely drifting away.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And she's giving away her inheritance?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's not about the money.
- It's usually about money.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But you have to be able to afford this statement:

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
500 per day plus expenses
plus apocalypse surcharge.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You can have 500 now.
You get 1,000,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
if you bring them back home
unharmed.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
* Mysterious sounds *

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
(I fundamentally mistrust anyone who

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
spends their free time
in the woods.)

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
There's something fishy going on.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Get going! Scram!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I'd love to. I have to find a
woman named Thaler first.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Who are you?
- Maloney, private detective.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Why are you looking for Mrs. Thaler?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm supposed to
free her from a cult.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
A group of lunatics preparing
for the end of the world.&lt;br&gt;

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Does this seem familiar to you?
- Now she's completely lost it.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Who?
- My daughter.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I've told her
a thousand times,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
\"The Last Day" is not a cult. How much did she pay you?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I'll pay double
if you leave right now.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Dead!
* Groaning *

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
What's going on here?
- My Spider Hole is an NSO.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Your what is a what?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
A Spider Hole is a hiding place and an NSO is

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
what a hiding place should never be: an unsafe place.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Are you playing hide and seek?
- What does he want?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Merci, I have my own
pocketknife.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
What is "The Last
Day", if it's not a cult?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
A nursery?
- We are preparing for Teotwawki?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Teotwawki?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
My daughter doesn't understand that.
- I don't either.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Teotwawki -
the end of the world as we know it.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And your daughter
has something against Anglicisms?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
She would rather I spent
the whole day knitting and watching television.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But I want to survive.
- Yes, that's what we all want.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
They have more
than just one screw loose.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Could you whistle your forest
back?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Watch out, no one whistles back at us. What do you want here?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Alright, Pesche, let
the old man have some space,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
he hasn't done anything wrong.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
As for you, you are all dead.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Dead, dead, dead, dead and dead.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
&lt;br&gt;The task was,&lt;br&gt;to hide.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
&lt;br&gt;That's elementary for survival&lt;br&gt;in
a post-apocalyptic world.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
&lt;br&gt;You've prepared, you&lt;br&gt;have water, you

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
have food maybe even still electricity.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
&lt;br&gt;The man here has nothing
anymore&lt;br&gt;and now he finds you.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
&lt;br&gt;Maybe you're
lucky&lt;br&gt;and he's friendly.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
maybe he's just hungry
and lost all sense of morality.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And then you are?
- Dead.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Right!

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The greatest danger
are always other people.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Except Gabi.
- Louder, Hans, we can't hear you.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Except Gabi.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Always just Gabi, Gabi, Gabi.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
* Giggling *

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Stop.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Gabi was the only one who stayed in
her hiding place and thus survived.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And what are you all then?&lt;br&gt;
- (All) Dead!

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
&lt;br&gt;Yes, the only difference between

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
survival and death&lt;br&gt;lies in constant suspicion.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
&lt;br&gt;Suspicion is our superpower.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
&lt;br&gt;I'm suspicious&lt;br&gt;of those types too.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
&lt;br&gt;Either they howl at the flat
moon&lt;br&gt;or have some other problem.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
&lt;br&gt;Where is Gabi?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
&lt;br&gt;Shouldn't we look for her?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Is good, Hans.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Task: Swarm out,
find Gabi. Allez hopp!

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Schneckenberger.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Maloney. Nice to meet you.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
People rarely come
to this part of the woods.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I just wanted a little
fresh air.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Mrs. Thaler doesn't really fit in with your group.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
She is one
of my best students.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Did you recruit her directly
from the nursing home?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Age
doesn't matter to us.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But what about the bank account?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
You're not really here for a sniff, are you?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
More like sniffing around?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Somehow one has to get
their oxygen.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
(Man) Help.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Potz!

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
* Threatening sounds *

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Attention, make way.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Make way.
- I'll take over.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Gabi.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Gabi?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Is this a drill?
- No, Gabi fell down here.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Come on, come on, come on!

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Have you seen it?
- No, we found her here.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Give me an EHS.
- EHS!

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Another abbreviation already?
- First Aid Kit.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Quickly, quickly, quickly!
- Left, right.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Step back!

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Gabi?
* Regular breathing *

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
How did the GABI work again?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
The GABI
can't help Gabi anymore either.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Isn't Schneckenberger clear
that Gabi is already dead?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Ah, Gabi!
- What's wrong?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Carry on!

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Carry on!
- It doesn't make any sense anymore.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
* Melancholic music *

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
(Either Gabi
was very unlucky

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
or Schneckenberger is right

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and the biggest danger
are the other people.)

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Shall we bury her now?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Well, I'm not a big fan
of the police,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
but usually they decide
whether someone is buried.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Okay, then we'll just call
the shepherds in uniform.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Yes.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Now look here, Maloney.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Are you with the Boy Scouts now?
- Those aren't Boy Scouts.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
They are preparing
for the apocalypse.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Yes, yes, I know,
survival of the fittest.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
This isn't for you, you
would die right away.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Now someone else
had to pay for it first.&lt;br&gt;

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Yes, we assume, that
Mrs. Gabrielle Mosimann

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
over the roots she tripped
and fell down into the ravine.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
In doing so, she
unfortunately bumped her head.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So unfortunate
is not even your wife.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Attention, Maloney! You would be amazed what

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
we have already seen as accidents at the police.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
* Murmuring *
I don't understand anything.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
He speaks rather softly,
you have to get closer.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
What did you say?
- Nobody would fall down there.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Gabi always played it safe.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
We communicated on important matters only

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
in code language or through dead letterboxes.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Now even mailboxes are dying.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
The post is no longer what it used to be.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
You don't believe, that
Gabi fell down here?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
This is the first phase of
grief processing: Denial.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
The other four will follow.
- I can hear you!

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Phase 2, Anger.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
That's an emergency number, you

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
can call anytime ... Bratwurst stamp card.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
(Something's not right.)

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
(I don't have any evidence and the authorities

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
aren't on my side, but it wasn't an accident.)

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
(Hans says so too.)

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
(I did &lt;br&gt;what I always
do in such cases:

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
stepping out of the
darkness into the light.)

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I called,
why aren't you answering?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
No battery.
- That's no excuse.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
No phone either.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Did something happen to my mother?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
She's fine.
- What's the police doing here?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Another woman is dead in the woods.
- I knew it.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
This forest is far too
dangerous for an old woman.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
You're taking me to her right now.
- Fine, come along.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Mom, I want to talk to you.
- But I don't want to talk to you.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Do we have a problem here?
- No!

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Ah, okay.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Mom, it's dangerous here.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It's dangerous in the
world, that's why I'm here.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
These aren't your friends,
they only want your money.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
At least I get
something for my money.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
When Teotwawki comes,
you need a bunker.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Teotwa... which bunker?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
You know, when the end of the world comes,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
we have a place in the bunker right over there.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
You spent your money
on a shitty bunker?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
That's not shitty.
- Mom, I'm having a baby.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
You can tell.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Maybe she isn't just after the money?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
&lt;br&gt;Should I come to your place and hold your hand?
- Yes!

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
&lt;br&gt;You're coming with me now!
-&lt;br&gt; No, no, no!

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
&lt;br&gt;Are you pregnant? &lt;br&gt;- Obviously.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
&lt;br&gt;No!

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
&lt;br&gt;Stop it!
&lt;br&gt;- No, you are not allowed to carry that.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
&lt;br&gt;Help me carry it, Maloney.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
&lt;br&gt;I shouldn't be lifting
heavy things either.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
&lt;br&gt;Why not? &lt;br&gt;- Because I don't want to.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
&lt;br&gt;I could help you.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
&lt;br&gt;Are you the daughter?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
&lt;br&gt;Are you the con man?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
&lt;br&gt;\"Frau Thaler." &lt;br&gt;Would you
like to sit down for a moment?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
&lt;br&gt;It is important and
right &lt;br&gt;to be concerned.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
&lt;br&gt;Nobody understands
this as well as we do.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
&lt;br&gt;But you can't force your
mother to come along.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And leave the tent alone,
it can't do anything about it.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
You are useless, I don't
need your help anymore.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Do you still want to
keep us company?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Gladly, someone has to make sure

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
that there aren't any more accidents.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
You don't think that was an accident?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Mistrust
is also my superpower.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
6 p.m.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Dinner.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Maybe someone will get nervous
if I stand around here long enough.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Men, women,
something bad has happened.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And actually
we should stop here.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
But that's not how we are, we are here for each other. Especially

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
when it gets tough and we are tested, we stand together and survive!

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Now. And when the last day comes.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Hans lost Gabi today.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
We lost Gabi today.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Let's hold hands now.
Close your eyes.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
* Gentle humming *

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
All we have
is us ...

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
... and our bunker.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And if
our internal alarm system goes off,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
then we'll get ourselves
to safety together.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
It could happen any minute.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
How much did you actually pay
for the bunker?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Is it at least nice?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
You haven't even been inside yet.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
It's only for emergencies.
- Yes, of course.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Of course there are outsiders
who try to divide us.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
He's talking about me.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
But we mustn't let ourselves
be unsettled by them.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
What does he
actually still want here?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
He also wants to give a speech.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Men, women.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Perhaps you can tell
me something about Gabi.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Mr.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Maloney,
that is not your assignment.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I have the feeling you liked
Gabi very much. Isn't that right?

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
- How can you say such a thing? Now is the
time when Hans needs to take a little courage.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Hans, we don't understand you.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
It is true.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
&lt;br&gt;We are a community
after all.&lt;br&gt;- You can't say that!

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
&lt;br&gt;Who among you had something
against Gabi?&lt;br&gt;- Nobody!

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
&lt;br&gt;Everyone.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
&lt;br&gt;You all thought,&lt;br&gt;that she was paranoid

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and asked too many questions.&lt;br&gt;- No!

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
&lt;br&gt;You're glad,&lt;br&gt;that she is dead.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
&lt;br&gt;Come on, please.&lt;br&gt;- What nonsense!

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Someone among
you pushed her down.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Who was that supposed to be?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Me?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Or him? Or her?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Or him? Or her? Or him?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
(Screaming)
Or maybe all of us together?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Come on, Hans? Huh? What's up?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Quiet!

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Life tests us, all of us.
Me too.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
It's not always easy.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Mistrust doesn't help now.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Hans was dumped by Gabi today.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
That's tough, it hurts,
that really hurts.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
But there are worse things.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Much worse things.
Teotwawki is worse.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
If you don't understand this,
if you don't understand this,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
then you are lost.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Dead, dead, dead,
dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
* They talk over each other. *

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
(As soon as a drop of uncertainty
has fallen,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
paranoia begins to grow.)

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
(I did what I always do in such cases:
take a little nap.)

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Let's see
if the bunker really exists.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
* Mysterious sounds *

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Are you hiding in the bushes?

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
I'm not hiding,
I just don't fall for it.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Bravo.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Beobachten Sie vielleicht
the group camping over there?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
My interest is only in the
satisfied inhabitants of the forest.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Of those, there are not
many left, by the way.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Especially since those
miserable preppers appeared here.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
They don't even take
nesting sites into account.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
They are preparing
for the apocalypse.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
For the birds
the apocalypse is already here.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Here is pure genocide taking place.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
I have already complained to the
community. In vain!

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
They are not here
because of the bird deaths either.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
No, because of human extinction.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
The best thing for nature
is one less human.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
There are too many of us anyway.
- Yes.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Did you see anything while birdwatching?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Oh yes.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
A rare capercaillie!

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
There.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Aha.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
The capercaillie has a mating call,
and it goes like this:

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
* Clicking, Gurgling *

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
You can't just
take those with you.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
I have to, for a good cause.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Do you still want the
protective case and the lens?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
No, no.
- Hello, that was really expensive!

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Mr. Schneckenberger?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Where is your Teotwawki guru?

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Murderer like to return
to the crime scene.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
(The last address of the camp leader

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
is directed at the fish in the stream bed.)

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
(People are dying like flies,&lt;br&gt;first
Gabi, now Schneckenberger.)

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
(Even the mailboxes are dead.)

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
(Perhaps Gabi left a message for posterity

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
in one of these mailboxes.)

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Where are they anyway?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
(Either dead Gabi communicated in other ways

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
or someone emptied the mailbox
before me.)

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Tough break Maloney, we're assuming,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
that Jürg Schneckenberger
tripped over the

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
roots, fell into the ravine and
unluckily hit his head.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Do I have déjà vu? Is
this not serious now?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
There are more things between heaven

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
and earth than one dreams of in school.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Goethe said so.
- That wasn't an accident.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
That you can tell the Holy Ghost,
not me!

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Statistically speaking that makes sense.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Many more people die in
accidents than by murder.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Schneckenberger murdered Gabi

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
and now someone wanted to play karma.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
The world has sunstroke, Maloney,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
no one sticks to the statistics anymore.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
One of you ...

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
... is a murderer.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Or a murderess.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Mama, what's going on?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Is everything alright, only
Schneckenberger is dead.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
What, but why? What is?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Calm down, I am investigating.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Suddenly you want to investigate.
What are you still doing here?

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Observing strange birds.
- Be quiet now! Sit down. Please!

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
We have
digital photographic evidence,

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
that Gabi
Schneckenberger was murdered ...

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
... that Gabi was murdered
by Schneckenberger.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
That's all fake!

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
These could be automatically
generated deepfakes.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
And even if, where do
they come from at all?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Why are there any photos
of us?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Are we being monitored here?
- No, no.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
By whom are we being
monitored here? My God!

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
This is worse than
back then with your files.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
No fish, birds!

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
These are random photos
from an ornithologist.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Ornithologist?
- I saw them.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
You have absolutely no idea.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Do you really believe,
that these are birds?

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Are you absolutely sure about that?

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Could the birds not
perhaps also be drones?

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Do you know,
that there are now more bird drones

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
than real birds in the sky?

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
This is not a question hour!
This is not a question hour!

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Are you afraid of questions?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Damn,
I am not afraid of questions!

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Listen up now! One has to be open to each other

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
and not always think, that one knows everything better.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
V.a., when one actually needs oneself.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
You all have a bird in your head here,
it's enough now!

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
What if you
liquidated Schneckenberger?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
He rebelled against the prison sowin'

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
and it became too much for you.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Neutral Switzerland is a farce.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
This has long been
a private company,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
but nobody dares to
open their eyes.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
I say, this is a farce!
And whoever gets too uncomfortable for you,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
is simply
shot dead.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
No, no, no,
nobody will be shot here.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Yes, they will only be arrested
and locked up for a long time.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
* Voices murmuring *

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Knife on the bread
and hands in your pants!

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
That's not a knife,
that's a machete.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Are you really that stupid?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
(When the crazies
and the clueless duel,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
one should stay out of the way.)

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
That's insulting language towards an officer,
you are under arrest.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
* Mysterious sounds *

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
(Freshly illuminated&lt;br&gt;I
went back to the last day.)

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
(High time to fulfill
their greatest desire:

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Teotwawki.)

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
* Piepsen *

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
The bunker alarm!
- The alarm has never gone off before.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
This is the real deal.
- Teotwawki.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Everyone into the bunker!
Women and Malones first.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Are we all going into the bunker
and I have to die out here?

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
No, I bought the bunker
for both of us,

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
so we can survive together.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Come on, let's go in. Come! Hans!

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
What's wrong with you, Hans?

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Do you rather not go into the bunker because

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
you already know, what is behind the door?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
You emptied the dead mailbox,
didn't you?

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
What is that? No, no, no!

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
* Smug laughter *

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
This is a protected area here,
you shitty bird murderer!

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Is that clear?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
* Bird call *

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
* Bird call *

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
* Bird call *

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Let me summarize again:

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
The world has not ended,
because the bunker did not exist.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
But mailboxes are dead?
- Correct.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
What's important for the police
is actually only,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
that the world
has not ended.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Such nonsense.
- Excuse me?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Schneckenberger killed Gabi.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Because of Hans?
- No, because of the bunker.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Yes, yes, the bunker.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
And Hans
killed Schneckenberger.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Because of the bunker?
- No, because of Gabi.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
It just came over me.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Oh dear, what have I done?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
That's now phase 4 of
grief processing: Despair.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Now only the fifth one
is missing: Acceptance.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
I am a murderer, oh God.
- Voilà.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
I am a murderer.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
So.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Now there's a bratwurst.
- Enjoy your meal.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
So.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
And now are you going home to knit?

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Certainly not. Just because the world
didn't end

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
today, doesn't mean
it won't end tomorrow.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
But now
we are at least together.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
(Ultimately, people prefer to be

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
paranoid together than sane alone.)

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
(Some are born for the
forest and others perish in it.)

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
(Some have a bird
and others are one.)

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
(Or maybe not.)

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Sometimes it's better, if
you don't look too closely.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
That's how it goes.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
