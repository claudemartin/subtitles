[[ auto-translated by gemma2:27b ]]

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.360
(Woman, sobbing)
You were surely sleeping.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.120
I didn't want to wake you, but something terrible happened ...

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.120
Oh God, what happened?
I'm sorry, I'm coming now.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.080
* Sigh *

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.640
* Soft piano music *

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.520
(The night
doesn't make life any better.)

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.400
(Only darker,
and that's good for our lot.)

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.560
(Because in the dark, things happen
that people want to hide.)

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.760
* She shivers. *

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.360
My ...

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960
My name ...

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.280
My Na...

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.360
I am ...

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.520
My name is Emilia Dobek.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.000
You can call me Emilia.
- Hm. Merci.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.039
Excuse me,
I really didn't want to wake you.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.600
You already said that
on the phone.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.400
And I don't want to bother you either.
- And yet here you are.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.200
Just make it
short and painless.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.520
It will be neither short nor painless.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.680
* Title music from "Philip Maloney" *

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.000
(Announcer) The hair-raising
cases of Philip Maloney.

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.760
Today: sleeping dogs.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
With subtitles by SWISS TXT Your

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.960
wallet is bleeding. I know this problem.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.040
That's not mine.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.079
I'm a sleepwalker.
For a long time. It's bad.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.640
Are you sleepwalking now too?

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.240
No, then I wouldn't know,
that I'm sleepwalking.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.680
Could you
search the wallet?

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.800
The only bloody thing,
that I touch,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.880
is a good piece of meat.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.360
* Tense sounds *

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.640
Thomas Schrämli.
Do you know a Thomas Schrämli?

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.720
I am a sleepwalker.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And I'm tired.

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.480
This is the first time,
that something like this has happened.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.600
Normally
I don't wake up at all,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.640
but before that I suddenly stood
in the city park. With this in my hand.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.400
And then came the police.
That's why I ran away.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.520
Yes, I have this flight instinct
with the police too.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.440
You have to help me.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.520
What if I hurt someone ...

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.680
What if I hurt someone ...

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.480
What is, if she killed someone?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Can you remember anything?

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.760
Please, you have to find out,
whether Mr. Schrämli is still alive.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.480
Otherwise I can never sleep again.
- I'll take a look at it.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.320
Lock me in here,
until you come back?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.920
I can't go home, then
I'll fall asleep again

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.040
and it starts all over again.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.080
I lost everything through sleepwalking,
even my dog.

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.600
Unfortunately, I can't offer you
accommodation for free.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.640
As an advance.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.320
(It was a mystery to me,
what was wrong with this Mrs. Dobek.)

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.760
(Perhaps she
is just one of those people,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.440
who go through life
with the wish

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.240
to remember as little as possible.)

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.320
Don't be ridiculous.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.280
* Mysterious sounds *

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.960
Now look here, from mountain and valley,
Maloney.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.320
I was wondering
when you would show up.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.960
It seems my client
hit the mark after all.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.560
Also, we have ...
- ... found a body.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.640
Yes.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.360
A man, 30 years old,
named Thomas Schrämli.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.040
You take away any joy in life.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.600
An acquaintance of yours?
- Sort of.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.120
Could you take a look at this?
- Yes, Merci.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.120
For once we were here before
you contaminated the crime scene.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.520
Nasty business, Maloney.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.560
Shot from behind with a blunt object.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.000
Uhm, beaten to death. No valuables.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.160
The perpetrator is at large.
- How did you get here?

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.680
We were called because of an argument.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.360
He obviously lost the argument.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.120
Who called?
- Anonymously.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.520
Can't you trace it back?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.760
That's not as easy as on TV.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.440
And it takes longer.
- You're no better off with me.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.520
Just longer.
- Ah, good.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.440
The victim's camper is free to go.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.640
Want me to take you with me?

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.720
I see everything a little differently.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.920
Yes, blurred and with 2.0 per mille.
- If it helps.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.840
It doesn't help if it doesn't hurt.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.240
Pardon.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.280
(Sighing) Maloney...

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.440
Aha.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.400
Well, someone has
been busy taking pictures.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.800
*Mysterious sounds*

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.120
Definitely a creep,
maybe even a pervert.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.760
Or a private detective.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.600
Who could it be?

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.960
What are you doing there?

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.440
The human nose can
identify over 10'000 smells.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.560
Even incompetent policemen?

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.000
It could help us,
solve a crime.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.120
Actually
sniffing is my profession.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.040
You are only
figuratively sniffers.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.840
And you are only
figuratively policemen.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.960
Quiet! I have to activate my nose.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.919
* Loud sniffing *

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.120
He's crazy.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.080
Mr. Maloney,
good that you are back.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
* Tense sounds *

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.880
Did you ever have a cat?

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.400
No.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.520
Didn't you paint it?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.560
No.
- Yes, but...- No!

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.000
Doesn't it say "PM"
for Philip Maloney?

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.320
It says:
"Don't touch my things."

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.320
Excuse me,
I just wanted to help.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.920
Are you going to put all of them on?

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.240
You found Schrämli.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.320
And how is he doing?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.800
According to the circumstances, bad.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.440
&lt;br&gt;He is dead.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.520
&lt;br&gt;Dead?

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.240
&lt;br&gt;Did I kill him?

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.600
he certainly didn't die of old age.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.120
&lt;br&gt;Can you remember
nothing?&lt;br&gt;- It wasn't me.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.280
&lt;br&gt;Are you sure?&lt;br&gt;- I am no murderer.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.960
&lt;br&gt;Who did it?&lt;br&gt;- Schrämli.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.480
&lt;br&gt;And who is that?

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.640
&lt;br&gt;The man or the dog?&lt;br&gt;- Both.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.880
&lt;br&gt;Do you meet strangers in your sleep?

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.560
&lt;br&gt;I don't know the
man,&lt;br&gt;I've never seen him.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.960
&lt;br&gt;The dead man
photographed me, &lt;br&gt;but why?

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.080
&lt;br&gt;Are you perhaps
famous?&lt;br&gt;- Not that I know of.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.720
&lt;br&gt;You don't seem to
know&lt;br&gt;much about yourself.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.960
&lt;br&gt;Find out.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.160
&lt;br&gt;And close up here again!

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.360
(I wasn't sure, if I should warn
the world about Mrs. Dobek

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.120
or Mrs. Dobek must
protect from the world.)

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.200
(Perhaps both.)

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.480
(But first I wanted to find out
more about this sleepwalking.)

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.960
The best sleep
researcher in town.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.040
And how do you sleep?

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.760
Mostly horizontally
under my desk.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.360
Excessive caffeine or alcohol consumption?
- If possible, yes.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.480
How do you feel each time
before falling asleep?- Tired.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.280
Please take the questions seriously.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.640
The reason for my sleep
disorder is a woman.- Interesting.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.800
We met at a self-help group for people

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.440
with sleep problems .- Very interesting.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.960
Is it possible, that one could hurt someone as a sleepwalker?

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.560
- Very, very interesting.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.840
You know, there is a lack of
courage, to research sleepwalking.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.360
It is still a black box.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.040
We have discovered impulses in the pineal gland

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.800
that indirectly interact with the thalamo- cortical system.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.480
Thal...amok...ortical system?
- For a long time, one assumed ...

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.160
... a dissociation ...
- Please again for people,

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.800
those who haven't swallowed a Nobel Prize?

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.880
Gladly.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.480
For 25 years I have been researching
the secrets

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.160
of sleep and somnambulism and have developed
a

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.680
revolutionary theory: In our sleep
we complete our self.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.320
What is hidden in the midbrain
awakens.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.480
All our suppressed desires
are to be found there.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.160
And what if those who yearn
kill someone?

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.400
That's
not a scientific question.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.520
It doesn't matter. I'm interested.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.400
You have no vision.
Think of the potential!

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.560
Multiple realities, freed from
the shackles of the controlling self.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.200
Well, I can do without these thoughts.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.280
You understand it anyway.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.800
You don't want to think,
hear or feel certain things.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.280
and banish them
into the subconscious.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.360
There is a splitting off, from which a

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.800
sleep-self with a parallel identity develops.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.320
My study will radically change the

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.880
entire understanding of the human psyche.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.640
The multiple self enables
access to untapped resources.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.560
For the job market, relationship

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.160
models, self-realization, freedom!

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.200
And is it possible to find out, what a sleepwalker does while sleepwalking?

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.800
- Finally a good question.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.320
Hopefully I'll finally
get a good answer too.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.400
My research investigates how the sleep-self

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.320
forms memories and is thus equal to our awake self.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.160
Do you see now the
scope of this discovery?

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.600
* Lascivious Whistling *

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.320
Does this also belong to your research?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.640
We do not judge
the activities of the sleepwalkers.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.720
We research and accompany.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.520
Fascinating, isn't it?

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.240
(The sleep-I's
seem to be doing strange things.)

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.880
(That's why it was time,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.960
to get to know the sleep-I
of my client.)

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.760
* Drowsy sounds *

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.640
Who wants to come out with me? Who?

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160
Mrs. Dobek?

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.040
Mrs. Dobek?

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.240
You found a wallet last night

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.400
Could you maybe tell me a little more about it?

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.880
Mrs. Dobek?

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.480
Are you a pervert?

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.000
Get out of here, right now!
Come on, Wuffgang, let's go!

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.480
* Mysterious sounds *

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.680
Come on.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.800
*Merry whistling*

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.240
(In this park
the sleepwalkers say goodnight

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.440
and the dog walkers.)

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.360
Are you bored?
- Not anymore.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.280
I think it's going to get cold.
Or maybe even winter.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.119
Yes, winter is coming.
So, uhm, soon.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.200
So, not so soon either.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.280
Also, he was just here.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.119
I've been thinking about
what you said last night.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.960
And I think, if I could,
then I would go to Sweden.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.200
It's always dark there in the winter.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.360
Then I could just sit
outside with you and ...

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.120
What kind of person are you?
- One who loves you very much.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.000
You scoundrel.
* Barking *

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.080
Mrs. Dobek.
- Hey wait, you sneak!

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.840
Mrs. Dobek!

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.480
* Maloney coughs. *

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.520
Mr. Maloney?

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.080
What did I do?

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.040
What did I do?

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.920
This can't be true,
what did I do?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I am a murderer ...

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.080
I am a murderer.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.920
What was that just now?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.640
I would like to know
that from you.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.000
I thought I was helping Emilia.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.960
Hug is my name, nice to meet you.
- Nice.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.960
And this is Chnurrli.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.320
Does Emilia sleepwalk?
- Exactly.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.240
Always?
- Only at night.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.200
But ...

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.760
I thought that ...

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.960
That can't be true because ...

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.120
Finish the sentence.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.440
Emilia showed up here
sometime ... with her dog.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.960
We have
a very special relationship.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.400
With her, life came into my ...

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.760
life.
- Exactly.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.280
She's always out at night, and so am I.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.480
You need to know, Chnurrli
has a daytime allergy.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.320
Chnurrli has what?
- A daytime allergy.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.600
Does the dog know anything about his luck?

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.880
I have an allergy to people
who only tell half the truth.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.280
I don't have to tell you anything.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.160
Did you meet with Mrs. Dobek last night too?
- Why?

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.520
Because there was a dead man nearby.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.800
A dead man? I have
nothing to do with that.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.200
And the gentleman, before he

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.800
died, took a few pictures of you.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.200
Didn't you notice that?
- No.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.800
Come Chnurrli, let's go!

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.720
I am against violence. Mostly.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.800
Actually always.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.480
Come Wuffgang, let's go.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.240
* Whining

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.480
* Come.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.360
And because my inner Maloney had an

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.360
idea where my client might be, I went there,

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.640
where every dream
becomes a nightmare.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.000
Mysterious music
drowns out the conversation. *

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.640
I'll be right back.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.800
I don't believe it, Maloney!
Mrs. Dobek confessed to the murder.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.840
She even had the victim's wallet
with her.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.040
She is innocent, this Mrs. Dobek,
the woman sitting here is innocent.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.280
Is there another Mrs. Dobek?

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.360
One Mrs. Dobek is awake, and

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.080
the other is a sleepwalker.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.520
That's probably why her
sleeping self Schrämli was killed.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.240
So it was her after all. In her sleep.
- The other one. Not this one.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.840
Nonsense. There was a murder,
and someone has to go in the box!

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.560
You're making a mistake.
- No, I'm not.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.520
The case is clear-cut:
Mrs. Dobek murdered Schrämli.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.720
Why then did Schrämli
photograph Mrs. Dobek?

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.800
Why, why, why, why?

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.560
People
sometimes do strange things.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.360
Look at yourself.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.440
* He laughs. *

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.280
* Mysterious sounds *

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.480
(While my waking self tried,

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.480
to find the bottom and the top
in this case,

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.040
my sleeping self led me
directly back to Schrämli

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.120
and his trailer.)

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.960
(Mr. Schrämli
thus photographed not only my client,

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.520
but all sorts of
sleepwalkers.)

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.600
(And he was particularly interested
in the gentleman,

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.480
who in his sleep
likes to lose his clothes.)

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.000
(Man) Night 12. City park.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.080
Good evening, Mr. Baumgartner,

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.160
are you sleepwalking naked again?

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.240
(Baumgartner) What? Well I ...

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.040
But you know me.
Thomas Schrämli.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.320
I am an assistant in the sleep laboratory.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.000
We talk together,
when you sleepwalk.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.480
What do you want from me?
- No memory. Never. With none.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.280
Schrämli questioned your theory.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.840
and thus put his research in jeopardy.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.160
Whoever thinks big, will be questioned.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.760
He worked here until you
dismissed him without notice.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.760
Schrämli was afraid of the
oppressed, the unconscious.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.840
He despised sleepwalkers.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.560
I, on the other hand, love sleepwalkers.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.880
After all, he then
pursued his own research.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.960
Night 13. City Park.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.440
Mr. Baumgartner, we have
already spoken last night.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.560
Go away!
- I want answers.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.960
Do you remember yesterday?
- That's enough!

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.000
He was obsessed with
Baumgartner. Do you know why?

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.600
Because he could prove,
that your theory is wrong.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.840
Did you kill him for that?

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.200
I know, that my
research is a success.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.080
And I can prove it to you, come.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.120
These recordings prove, that Mr.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.680
Baumgartner can remember
previous sleep phases.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.080
He sleepwalks and trains
his memory in the process.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.600
For a wrong answer he
gets a small electric shock.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.120
See: several nights later.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.280
Memories have formed.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.560
Baumgartner already knows considerably
more about the correct sequence.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.680
He learns and develops
further. In his sleep!

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.120
Mr.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.280
Baumgartner has a second identity.
With feelings, memories - a second life!

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.840
Thomas Schrämli was
afraid of this second life.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.440
(I asked myself, whether the clever

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.360
professor hid a murder behind all the words.)

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.560
(Or whether clever
talk simply remains talk.)

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.080
* Whistling *

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.800
That seems somehow familiar to me.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.520
Mr. Baumgartner?

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.080
Yes? Do we know each other?
- Not directly.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.880
I'm from the association
Anonymous Somnambulists.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.280
We take care of the well-being of

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.920
all sleepwalking
people and animals.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.360
Are there sleepwalking animals?

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.720
There's everything possible that

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.800
sleepwalks: birds, dogs, murderers.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.360
Murderers?

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.680
A Mr. Schrämli followed
some of our members.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.760
Do you know him perhaps?
- No.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.240
I'm sorry,
I can't help you further.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.240
I have a lot to do.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.560
Now please let me through.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.640
* Discomforting sounds *

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.120
(I had this feeling,

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.400
that the model subject Baumgartner
is the key to everything.)

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.800
(It is time, to conduct my own
experiment.)

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.600
(And to beat myself another night
silly.)

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.680
* Whistling *

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.920
* Carefree music, whistling *

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.240
Baumgartner.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.120
It was you!

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.920
You slipped Schrämli's wallet
from him.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
He... What?

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.520
And you killed him.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.800
I saw it.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.000
You are sleepwalking, aren't you?

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.320
Why do you remember?
That's impossible.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.560
You can also remember.
Or are you maybe a cheater?

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.640
I...

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.200
Just wait, I'll finish you!

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.520
Leave me alone, or
you'll be dead soon too.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.280
Don't move! Drop your
hands, rock in the air!

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.240
Immediately!

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.120
Wonderful performance
Mrs Dobek, bravo!

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.760
Thank you very much, Mr Maloney.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.360
Don't you sleepwalk at all?
- Not now. I used to.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.920
And you never
sleepwalk, is that right?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.720
That's a fraud!
- What, Maloney?

00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.000
He's not a sleepwalker at all?
- The gentleman pretended.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.840
You are under arrest, for
disturbing the public peace.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.200
Yes, and especially for murder!
- What, that too?

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.640
Mr Schrämli wanted to
disprove the professor's

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.920
theory and thereby
discovered our fake sleepwalker.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.600
Baumgartner is
actually a sleepwalker.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.920
He likes to undress in front of others.
- That's forbidden!

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
I had to kill Schrämli.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.480
While sleepwalking
I could just be myself.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.320
And Mrs. Dobek was simply
in the wrong place at the right time.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.080
A sleepwalker who can't remember anything, perfect plan.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.360
Hey, hey, hey,
Violence is not the solution!

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.640
You're coming with me, Mr. Baumberger.
- Gartner, not Berger.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.520
One more word and I'll shoot you
on the spot while escaping.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.240
Either on the run
or on the spot.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.560
You are a know-it-all?

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.040
Now there's peace! Come along.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.040
It's just enough
for the late broadcast of "Meteo".

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.840
Look.
You forgot this.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.560
* Barking *

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.520
I would like to introduce
you to someone.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.600
This is Mr. Hug.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.680
Hello.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.320
Good evening.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.720
*Soft music*

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.280
Well, I think I'll be going.
It's getting late.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.560
*Whining*

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.120
Mr. Hug.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.800
Goodbye.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.880
Bye, Chnurrli.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.840
(With the pain
I couldn't help.)

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.000
(He had to
suppress it alone.)

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.520
(Maybe it really was just
a dog's love.)

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.960
(Fortunately, there are no
suppressed emotions in a Maloney.)

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.040
(Or longings.)

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.400
(That's how it goes.)

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.720
