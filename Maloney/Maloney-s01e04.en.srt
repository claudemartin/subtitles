2
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,480
(People are waiting for different things.)

3
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,320
(I'm waiting for a client who still 
has all their marbles.)

4
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,240
There was the corpse.

5
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,080
Not anymore.

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,120
I'm not stupid.
The corpse was right here.

7
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,400
That’s what it looked like.
- Yes, not a pretty sight.

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,920
Mr. Maloney,
I was so scared,

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,600
that I slammed the elevator door shut.

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,000
Then the elevator went down
and I brought it back up.

11
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,280
And then the corpse
dissolved into thin air.

12
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,320
Where were you going,
so late at night?

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,760
I haven't been able to sleep for weeks,
because I hear voices from the basement.

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,120
I pulled myself together,
went to check,

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,400
and there greeted me the corpse.
- What did the voices say?

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,640
*Gurgling, whimpering*

17
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
So.

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,400
Sounds like a foreign language.

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
And are you sure,

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,400
that no neighbor slept off their 
intoxication in the elevator?

21
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,720
I can tell an alcohol-induced death from
a real corpse.

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800
I'm currently painting a
phantom image. Oh. Abstract.

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,840
It's not finished yet.
- And what does the police say?

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,680
It's always the same person on the phone, 
whom I have to explain everything 3 times.

25
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,080
Then he told me, without a
corpse he's not responsible.

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,720
And what am I supposed to do now?

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,720
Make sure
I'm not an idiot.

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Find the corpse.

29
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,120
* Title music by "Philip Maloney" *

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,440
The hair-raising cases
of Philip Maloney.

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,920
Today: "The Elevator".

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
With subtitles by SWISS TXT

33
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,160
(For a reasonable fee,
I am willing,

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,760
to accept even invisible corpses
for hard cash.)

35
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,800
(Let's see if the voices in
the basement are of human origin.)

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,960
* Unsettling sounds *

37
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
Wine.

38
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,720
Someone has locked up the wine.

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,720
Perhaps
I can free a bottle.

40
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
* Scream *
What are you doing here?

41
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,760
And you?
Are you the house ghost?

42
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,440
Have you seen Edi?
- No, just the Pinot.

43
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,280
Do you have something
to do with his disappearance?

44
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,520
Is Edi the man from the elevator?

45
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,480
Edi is my tomcat. He
is allergic to people.

46
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Who? Him or you?

47
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,960
Now you're thinking, I'm a social

48
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,800
outcast because I live alone with my cat.

49
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,520
Who is really a social outcast,
is the woman on the second floor.

50
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,320
She doesn't even dispose
of her trash properly.

51
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,880
We have designated trash bags here.

52
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
* Creaking *

53
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Edi?

54
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,440
* Unsettling sounds *

55
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Metallic rattling.

56
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
(Someone who doesn't dispose 
of the trash properly

57
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,600
may have other things to hide.)

58
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
* Doorbell *

59
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,760
* Footsteps *

60
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Hello?

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,200
* Energetic Doorbell *

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,480
She might not be home at all.

63
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,760
Or she doesn't want to receive anyone.

64
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,800
You look, as if you
could use a cup of tea.

65
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,520
My appearance is deceiving.
- Inner values count.

66
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,000
I am interested in the inner
workings of the elevator.

67
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,760
A corpse has apparently surfaced there.
- Who says that?

68
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,120
Mrs. Rausch.
- That is clearly a cry for help.

69
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,280
The situation is simply
terrible lonely and ...

70
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,320
And with a corpse
one is less lonely and ...

71
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,960
Did you know that loneliness
is as deadly as smoking?

72
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,480
One has to die of something.

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
* Laughs * But first,

74
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,760
there’s tea. Come, come.

75
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Sit down.

76
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,920
Perhaps
she has a corpse in the closet.

77
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,680
(One has garbage bags in the closet,
the other disposes of them incorrectly.)

78
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,640
(The house seems
to have a waste problem.)

79
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,320
The table is here.

80
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
It's nice here.

81
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
A home remedy.

82
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,040
With your own herbs and roots.

83
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Cleansing.

84
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
And works wonders.

85
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,920
Do drink the tea,
it’s getting cold.

86
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,040
What are you planning with
those clothes in the closet?

87
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,200
They're for a good cause.

88
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,120
I am very committed to those,
who are not as well off as we are.

89
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,080
Perhaps you could use something.

90
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
No.

91
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,520
Did you hear strange noises last night?

92
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Voices from the basement or something 
like that?

93
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,000
No, it was actually
a very quiet night.

94
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,840
I slept like an angel.
Drink your tea.

95
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,159
No thank you.

96
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,120
I think
my liver can't handle it.

97
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Adieu.

98
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
Adieu.

99
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,480
(I have the feeling,
the elevator here is the only thing

100
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,040
that isn’t leading me around by the nose.)

101
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,920
Have you hidden a body somewhere?

102
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
* Unsettling sounds *

103
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,760
(Maybe the stain
is from the body.)

104
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,960
(Or maybe
from a bloody steak.)

105
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,000
(At best,
there’s warm food in the soup kitchen

106
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,720
along with a hot lead - win-win.)

107
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,560
Lentil soup or cauliflower soup?

108
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,440
How about a steak?
- Everything here is vegetarian.

109
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,840
Then a coffee.
- Anything else?

110
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,320
Has anything unusual happened here lately?

111
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,480
Anyone gone missing?

112
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,920
That is a soup kitchen.
People come and go.

113
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,760
Psst, come here.

114
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,560
Don't look so, or they'll notice.
- What will they notice? And who is she?

115
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,440
The angel Cherubim.
Strange things are happening.

116
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,880
Burning wheels,
at least six wings.

117
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,440
And millions of eyes,
looking on.

118
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,040
That's always how it is
before the end of the world.

119
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,560
Haben Sie in der letzten Zeit
wohl zu viel Suppe gegessen?

120
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,760
The angel distributes jobs.

121
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,080
He's recruiting for the apocalypse.

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,040
I know everything.

123
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,760
Then you should
maybe write a book.

124
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Is she your cherub?

125
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,000
No, she just asks stupid questions.

126
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,920
Shall we go?
- You may stay.

127
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,040
I must
look for my invisible corpse.

128
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,400
(Without a trace and without a steak
 my win-win has

129
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,680
rather turned into a lose-lose.)

130
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,520
(As if that weren't
enough, I'm being pursued.)

131
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Do you want to play hide and seek?

132
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,720
Are you a private detective?
- It says so on the door.

133
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,160
Lea Bleising.
- Great. And what do you want from me?

134
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,040
Wow, you have one of
those, crazy. Totally retro.

135
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,480
I only have one.
- No cell phone?

136
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,280
Cell phones don't
have a battery just

137
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,400
when you need them most.
- A real detective.

138
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,320
What were you doing
at the soup kitchen?

139
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,440
Most soups are boring.
Except alphabet soup.

140
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,960
She has the attention
span of a squirrel.

141
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,080
I followed you.
- (Sarcastically) What? And why?

142
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,440
To find out if you know anything
about Tim's disappearance.

143
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,040
I don't know any Tim.
- He used to study with me.

144
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,720
That's usually a
matter for the police.

145
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,440
Now leave my things alone!

146
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,000
They say he's old
enough to go underground.

147
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,040
So you thought you'd
play detective a little bit?

148
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,480
Exactly.
- Have fun. There’s the door.

149
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,400
I found in a forum
cold cases of other missing persons.

150
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,480
And where were they last seen?

151
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,960
In my office?
- In the soup kitchen.

152
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,400
People
disappear from the soup kitchen?

153
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,960
What if Tim
got involved in a drug ring?

154
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,360
He stumbled upon the secret
of the Big Boss,

155
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,280
they lured him into a trap
and killed him.

156
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
* Telephone ringing *

157
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,160
No, I haven’t found your corpse
yet.

158
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,640
I’m coming.

159
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,520
What kind of case is this?

160
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,040
I’m not even sure
if it is one.

161
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,120
What are you investigating?

162
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,640
A corpse has disappeared.

163
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,960
What is our next step?
- Ours? You're looking for Tim.

164
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,240
Maybe he's run away.
What's the address?

165
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,480
You can't come with us.
- Why?

166
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,960
I can't afford
an intern.

167
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,960
Do you not have enough money?
- No, not enough nerves.

168
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,040
Come on!

169
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,160
(I hope she is gone.)

170
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,080
(I prefer invisible corpses
to visible annoyances.)

171
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
* Uncomfortable sounds *

172
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640
How did you find me?

173
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,880
You can be tracked with an app.

174
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
* Doorbell rings *

175
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
(Mrs. Rausch)
It’s open.

176
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,560
Ah, have you
brought support with you?

177
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,040
Not really.
She ran to me.

178
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,480
Lea Bleising.
I am supporting the investigation.

179
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,240
Look, the composite sketch
is just finished.

180
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,400
Not bad. Everything with wine?

181
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,400
Nero d'Avola, a southern grape.
Pinot is too thin.

182
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,400
So that's our corpse.
- That's Tim!

183
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Well, look...

184
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,240
We're working on the same case.
We'll find the corpse.

185
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,840
May I take this with me?
- Yes, gladly.

186
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,320
Now we need the police to help us.

187
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,360
When you're young, you're
still allowed to have illusions.

188
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
* Gentle sounds *

189
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,280
(Speakers) We sink
deep into the ground...

190
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,720
...while we let the breath flow.

191
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,840
We breathe in… And out again.

192
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Hey, what’s that supposed to mean?

193
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,240
Haben wir Ihr
Mittagsschläfchen gestört?

194
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,640
That’s not a nap,
that’s meditation.

195
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,240
You have no idea, Maloney.
It's important, against burnout.

196
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,680
You take care of it not worried

197
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
citizens like Mrs. Rausch.
- Rausch ...

198
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,520
Ah, the missing corpse.
- Tim Wiesenbach.

199
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,800
Has been missing for three
weeks. Now he is dead.

200
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,320
Did you paint this, Mrs.…
- Bleising. No, Mrs. Rausch.

201
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,880
Very complex. Bravo.

202
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
So, are you doing anything now?

203
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,760
There's nothing to do. Mrs.
Bleising is not entirely accountable.

204
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,840
I am Mrs. Bleising.

205
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,720
I said so. She hears
voices, sees corpses.

206
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,840
An artist, it’s all imagination.

207
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,200
Look in the system, to see if
anyone in the house is suspicious.

208
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,720
Have you ever heard of
data protection, Madam ...

209
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,840
What if Tim was lured into the house under 
false pretenses and killed there?

210
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
- And why?

211
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,800
Maybe someone in the 
house is a cannibal and

212
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,240
occasionally picks a person 
from the soup kitchen.

213
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,960
Because he's craving something
other than vegetable soup.

214
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Exactly, Bro.

215
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
That would be really good ...

216
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,320
Elevator shaft 5.

217
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Don't touch it.

218
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,160
Ah, here.
Kaja Lutz, previously convicted.

219
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,560
Cannibalism?
- Improper disposal of garbage?

220
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,800
No, she stole a few
utensils from the hospital.

221
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
Okay. Enough.

222
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,000
* Gentle sounds *
(Loudspeaker) Feel your body...

223
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,600
He meant, Mrs. Lutz.
Come on, we need to talk to her.

224
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,120
* Uncomfortable sounds *

225
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
Maybe she's hiding.

226
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
* Elevator *

227
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Creepy.

228
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Did you steal Edi?

229
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
No.

230
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,359
Who are you actually?

231
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,520
Lea Bleising, private detective.

232
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,079
Then can you find my Edi?

233
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,200
Oh, a cat!

234
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,440
Please bring him home.
There's also a reward.

235
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,640
We can't take on new cases
we're at risk of burnout.

236
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
I'll take care of it.

237
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
* Uncomfortable sounds *

238
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
* Energetic ringing *

239
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,520
Maybe she's hiding.
You can't run away.

240
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,240
We have a case to solve.
- We don't have anything to solve.

241
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,000
I need
no sidekick with ADHD.

242
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
* Awkward sounds *

243
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,120
Mrs. Lutz?

244
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,600
You're not so strict with 
the garbage separation?

245
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
What are you? A waste detective?

246
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,800
This is my assistant, Mr. Maloney.
Lea Bleising ...

247
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,640
Did you hear something suspicious?
- No.

248
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
You stole from the hospital.

249
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,720
Do you have a laboratory
for illegal experiments?

250
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,160
Someone has a vivid
imagination. I like that.

251
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,000
We would like to inspect your trash.
- Why?

252
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,040
In this elevator
a corpse has disappeared.

253
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,200
Has Mrs. Rausch
seen ghosts again?

254
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,480
No, a corpse.
Is it in your bag?

255
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,440
Excuse me?

256
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,560
Do you have a corpse in your bag?
- No.

257
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,760
Okay, cool. Can I look inside?
- Is she crazy?

258
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,120
Listen, I actually think you shouldn’t

259
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,920
interfere in the affairs of your neighbors.

260
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,520
But Mrs. Rausch likes 
to consume a little more

261
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,360
than the recommended amount of alcohol.

262
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,320
Of course, there are
one or two side effects.

263
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,280
Anything else?
- No, adieu.

264
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,040
Adieu.

265
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
She's lying! We have to follow her.

266
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,880
 I'm hungry.
- What kind of detective are you?

267
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,960
A hungry one. 
- One has to do everything oneself.

268
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,560
(Over the years, you learn not
to chase every lead immediately.)

269
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,600
(And you can't solve cases
on an empty stomach.)

270
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,400
Nero d'Avola.
A good drop, drinkable.

271
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,400
Is that one of those
who got a job?

272
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,880
They saw him,
the many eyes.

273
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,840
Cherubim took him with him.

274
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
He is here.

275
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
The corpse?
- Cherubim.

276
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,280
I have started with the book.
- Ah, great.

277
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
* Threatening sounds *

278
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
I know those.

279
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
It certainly looks like

280
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,000
Mrs. Engel
has just started her shift.

281
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,400
So the perfect window of opportunity
for a house call.

282
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,760
The woman
promised Tim a job, then.

283
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,280
But is she also an angel of death?

284
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
* Creaking *

285
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,320
It certainly looks like it.

286
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
* Creaking *

287
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,080
One really shouldn't
interfere in the affairs of others.

288
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
(As a child, I wondered how one

289
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,920
gets to the afterlife, when one dies.)

290
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,400
(I wouldn't have thought, that it
would happen with the elevator.)

291
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,960
Where are we going?

292
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
To heaven.

293
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Why is it going down then?

294
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,040
Such a high tolerance
for narcotics.

295
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,120
is not good for the liver.

296
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,800
(What kind of detective are you?)
- (A hungry one.)

297
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
Everything has to be done yourself.

298
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
* Expectant sounds *

299
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,840
* Phone ringing *

300
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yes?

301
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Okay.

302
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Good.

303
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'll take care of it.

304
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
* Buzzing of flies *

305
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,000
Fuck. I was completely right.

306
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
* Busy signal *

307
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,560
Shit.

308
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Okay.

309
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,440
I was right, it was Mrs. Lutz.
I knew she was suspicious.

310
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,040
What are you doing?

311
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,480
Thank God.
You absolutely have to help me.

312
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,560
What's wrong?

313
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,520
Something terrible happened to Mr. Maloney.

314
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,680
It's awful.

315
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,280
* Sobbing *

316
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,160
How did you get in here?

317
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,560
*Uncomfortable sounds*

318
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
*Suffocated noises*

319
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,800
Let's get it over with.
- That's easily said,

320
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,000
when you don't do the dirty work yourself.

321
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,000
What's that supposed to mean now?
- What do we do with him?

322
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,600
The same as always.

323
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,680
You can't sell his busted organs to anyone.

324
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,240
He knows too much, he has to go.

325
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,440
*Clears throat* Weren't
you taught that it's

326
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,280
impolite to talk about people
who are present?

327
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,880
Speak of the devil.
- That's more likely you.

328
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,400
*Choked sounds*

329
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
She wants to say something.

330
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
Is that necessary?

331
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,880
You have Edi on your conscience!

332
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,120
That stupid cat was already
dead before we moved in.

333
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,560
And you just stole it?
- Exactly.

334
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,760
Can we please start now?

335
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,520
Why don't you do something yourself.

336
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,200
Don't act like you're
doing everything alone.

337
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,880
Without the people from the soup
kitchen we wouldn't have anything to sell.

338
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,760
Are you trying to fool me? You
can't get anything more out of it.

339
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,440
Then we’ll just throw it away completely.
- (In pain) Ah.

340
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,920
Ah, my eyes!

341
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Then I’ll just do it myself.

342
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,200
I'm too old for playing doctor.
- This isn’t a game.

343
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,440
This is your end. What
can you still accomplish?

344
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,480
I nothing. But her.

345
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
Bro.

346
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,160
Maloney. I’ve been
off work for a long time.

347
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Couldn't you have exposed those

348
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,480
two ladies during office hours?

349
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,840
You are fortunately a civil
servant and can write off overtime.

350
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,400
What exactly happened now?
- It's very simple.

351
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:32,440
Mrs... Mrs. Kaja Lutz and 
Mrs. Christina Engel operated...

352
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,040
 an illegal laundry business from
from their organic kitchen.

353
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
And what's that supposed to mean?

354
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,520
Notes.
For my first crime novel.

355
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,520
The woman in the house with 
the corpse in the elevator,

356
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,880
which the police didn't believe.
- Realistic.

357
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,360
Everyone knows better
than the police again.

358
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,640
It's high time
he understood that.

359
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,160
But please, I mean, how did
the corpse get into the elevator?

360
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,440
Mrs. Engel recruited young people
in the soup kitchen.

361
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,200
Mrs. Lutz sedated them, 
together they drove them

362
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,520
with the elevator to the
laundry room and killed her.

363
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,040
When I saw the body,
was she still alive?

364
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,440
That's right. Strictly speaking,
your corpse wasn't a corpse at all.

365
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,080
So you're an idiot.
- Shit.

366
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,640
Mission accomplished.

367
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
Thank you.

368
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,080
I’m an idiot.

369
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,000
Alright, make way,
I want to go home.

370
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,560
What should I do with them?

371
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Best to get rid of them.

372
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
Your share.

373
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,640
Not necessary.
I solved my own case.

374
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,920
(A new blood detective,
who gets more pay

375
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,760
for a stuffed cat than we do
for solving a murder case -

376
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,920
that gnaws at your self-esteem.)

377
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It’s time to leave.

378
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,040
Where are we going?
- Not "we". You.

379
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,720
Okay. Maybe I’ll actually
do an internship with you.

380
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,400
(Just whiskey left -
that’s good for my health.)

381
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,960
(Who wants
the liver of a boozer?)

382
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
(That’s how it’s done.)

383
