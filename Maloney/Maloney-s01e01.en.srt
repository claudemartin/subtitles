*Mysterious Sounds*

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,400
(Man) And so I have decided
to rethink

4
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,240
to surround myself only with what I love.

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,800
Have you ever seriously
dealt with the question

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,880
of what you really need?

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,080
I have dropped my last name
and now call myself only Marco.

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,160
Without a last name, just Marco.

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,480
<br>Too much of everything
in our lives.<br>I'm a minimalist.

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,160
<br>The less I own,<br>the happier I am.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,800
<br>And the less time<br>I have to

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,880
spend with you, the happier I am.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,280
<br>My girlfriend Selina thinks like me -<br>at least I thought

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,360
so, but now I don't know anymore,<br>what I should think.

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,520
He should stop thinking,
because he can't do it well anyway.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,440
Is there love in your life?

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,640
You know, love is actually quite minimalist:

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,920
I give everything and want nothing in return.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,560
That's how I live.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,840
That's why I decided to

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,360
rethink everything, completely...

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,800
Oh, what's wrong? My sweater!

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,080
My clients like to start burning

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,200
if they don't get to the point.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,920
It's a designer piece, unique.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,520
So am I, so get to the point!

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
Selina has been working as a secretary at a law firm

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,320
for a few months and has become materialistic now.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,039
Also if she comes with a lot of
money, you can send her to me.

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,200
Much worse:
She came home with a car.

31
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
With a Porsche!
- Oh dear.

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,600
I'm afraid Selina is having an affair

33
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,680
with her boss, that sleazy lawyer.

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,840
I'm also worried: that she

35
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,360
won't be able to pay my fee.

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,640
I am a minimalist, not poor.

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,560
Difficult lawyers
cost extra.

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,120
Do you cost even more?
- Yes.

39
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Now you have to deliver.

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,640
Find out,
whether my girlfriend is having an affair.

41
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,960
It's actually
never a good sign,

42
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,320
when my clients
give me a lot of money.

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,640
* Theme music from "Philip Maloney" *

(Announcer) The hair-raising cases
of Philip Maloney.

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,520
Today:
A lawyer rarely comes alone.

With subtitles by SWISS TXT

47
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,880
Watch out!

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,800
Now you've almost given me a headache.

49
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
Oh no, the two of them.

50
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,079
Good day.
- Good day.

51
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,720
* Loud voices in the background

52
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
* What's going on here?

53
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,320
It's just hell today, they don't
usually complain like that.

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,120
(Woman) How could this get out?
- (Man) Yeah, how, how, how?

55
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,960
What's the result?
- If you don't know that,

56
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,440
then you don't need to
know it. How can I help you?

57
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,880
I'm doing a survey
with assistants.

58
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,160
It's about minimalism
and free cars.

59
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Did Marco send you?

60
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,800
Tell him it's not
always all about him.

61
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,000
Certainly, but who is it about then?

62
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,640
(Man) You always
have to accuse me.

63
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,560
Ah, Mr. Maloney, Philip Maloney.

64
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,840
We know each other.
- Yes, unfortunately.

65
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,480
He's a lawyer, but not one of the
good ones, if there even are any.

66
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,560
He's a private
detective, but not one

67
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,640
of the good ones, if there even are any.

68
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,800
His wife, also a lawyer.

69
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,120
Together they are
trouble and strife.

70
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,440
What does he want?
- What do you want from us?

71
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,800
Is he here about the case?
- Are you here about the case?

72
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,160
Case?
- We're not answering any questions!

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Do you want to say anything else?
- No, he doesn't.

74
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,560
It's extremely inappropriate right now.
- He should leave.

75
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Who is this about?

76
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
About me.

77
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Isn't it really about the incredible ...

78
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Albrecht,
you don't speak to Mr. Maloney!

79
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,040
(With so many closed doors
I wondered,

80
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
if Selina's secret

81
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,800
really only involved a gifted
Porsche.)

82
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,000
(I had to examine the matter from a new perspective.)

83
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
* Mysterious Sounds *

84
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Maloney.

85
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,440
Not now, I'm meditating.

86
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,880
A resident has complained
about a prowler.

87
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,440
I haven't seen anyone.
- You are the prowler, Maloney!

88
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,120
Theoretically he's right,
but practically he's annoying.

89
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,480
Are you here because of the insults?
- No, because of the beautiful view.

90
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Prostitution is a crime.

91
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Go home or
I'll take you to the station.

92
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Yes, yes.

93
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,720
* Mysterious sounds *

94
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
* Phone ringing *

95
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,320
Mr. Maloney, I need your help.
It's urgent.

96
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Mrs. Schimpf needs my help?

97
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Attention.

98
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
What's wrong with him?

99
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
He found her.

100
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,720
Where is the police?
- They're coming right away.

101
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,600
I wanted you to see the
crime scene first.- Why?

102
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,920
Mom? 
- Rest nicely.

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,680
You surely want to
see the body, don't you?

104
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,120
It looks like a watermelon,
on which a bocce ball hit.

105
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
What do you mean?
- She is dead.

106
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,840
Obviously, anything else?
- Art has also suffered.

107
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,200
Is that your husband's
office? Where is he?

108
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,280
You don't know where your husband is?

109
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
That makes him suspicious.

110
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,720
What do you want from me? An alibi?

111
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
I'd prefer the murderer.

112
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,720
And if you don't find him,
other suspects.

113
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,880
Can't your husband be the murderer?

114
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,840
That doesn't fit his character.
- Did he have an affair with her?

115
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,120
That fits
his character much better.

116
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,320
But I have no proof of that.

117
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,720
Who killed her then?
- You are responsible for that.

118
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,840
The police will be here soon, and they'll think, what

119
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,760
everyone thinks: A lawyer has an affair with his secretary.

120
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,320
She wants to end
it,<br>he can't bear it.

121
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,520
Kill her and flee.
* Sirens *

122
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,680
Albrecht, are you letting the police in?

123
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,840
If I find out
that your husband is the murderer,

124
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
I won't keep it to myself.

125
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
Selina stayed overnight here,

126
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,640
so maybe Marco wasn't her great love after all.

127
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
Oh, wow.

128
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,720
Don't touch, please.
Do you like it?

129
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
Yes.

130
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,360
It reminds me somehow of my

131
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,400
mother: gentle, but also very loud.

132
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,200
Exactly, when I ...
- You don't talk to the police.

133
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,920
For any questions, contact me.
- Maybe I can help.

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,200
No, you can't help. We
refuse to make a statement.

135
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,120
Maloney, the city's notorious fixer.
What are you doing here again?

136
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,160
Without official summons he does
not have to answer any questions.

137
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,160
If it were that simple ...
- Do you want to see the body?

138
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Who found the body?

139
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,040
My son, he's working
on his artwork.

140
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
Very talented, the
young man, very talented!

141
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,640
And where is your husband?
- On a plane, on business trips.

142
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,600
Since when? Now please
don't make it so hard for me.

143
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,360
As the wife of Mr. Schimpf
I don't have to answer you.

144
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,720
That's called the right
to refuse testimony.

145
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,320
And as Mr. Schimpf's lawyer, my

146
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,800
communication is subject
to attorney-client privilege.

147
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Have a nice day.

148
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,320
Have you now become
the lapdog of the Schimpfs?

149
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,000
They're just afraid that the
police won't do a good job.

150
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
What can you possibly do wrong?

151
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,920
A lawyer has an affair with a secretary,

152
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
she wants to break up, he kills her and flees.

153
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,520
(I didn't feel any better
despite all the money.)

154
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,240
(Actually, I already had a client.)

155
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,280
That happens when
you have love in your life.

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,080
That was definitely this insult.

157
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,160
First he has an affair with
Selina and then he kills her.

158
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,920
I don't know if you can
even call that an affair.

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What?

160
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,600
Your beloved girlfriend
stayed overnight at the office.

161
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,800
Apparently she reduced the
relationship to less than a minimum.

162
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,760
That was just temporary,<br>she
would have come back.

163
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
He seems more like someone

164
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,840
whose favorite toy has been taken away.

165
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,320
She even
left her Porsche here.

166
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
She would have come back.

167
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,880
They always do.
- But not this time, hm?

168
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
* Mysterious sounds *

169
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,200
(The question is, how possessive
the Minimalist really is.)

170
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,440
(And who Selina was,
who had given her this car.)

171
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,800
(I did what I
always do in these situations.)

172
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Drink, don't drive.

173
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
* Expectant Music *

174
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,120
Yeah, we are searching for Schimpf.
Yes, of course. I got the Number.

175
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,480
Yes, yes, yes.

176
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,560
Thank you, thank you very much.

177
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,880
Yes, yes. We will. 
We will, thank you.

178
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,080
Maloney, what do you want?

179
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,200
I need to know
who the car belonged to.

180
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,160
* Phone ringing *
Hello?

181
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
Ah oui. Yes, yes, yes.

182
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,920
Ah, yes. Yes, yes ... Yes,
yes, yes. Thank you, thank you.

183
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,680
Yes, French.
- Do you want to emigrate?

184
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,000
We are looking for Schimpf.

185
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,960
We have set up an
international task force.

186
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,440
With all these countries
we are in contact.

187
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,600
Everything is interconnected, Maloney.

188
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,480
And what if Schimpf
hasn't flown away at all?

189
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
* Phone ringing *

190
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,280
* He speaks in a foreign language. *

191
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
So.

192
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,720
Who owned the car before?
- Why do you want to know?

193
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,400
Selina Kaiser got this car
shortly before her death.

194
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,000
That's a real lead, Maloney.

195
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,560
Have you had further training?

196
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,040
Well then, let's scan it.

197
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,200
(Scanner)
Thank you for your input.

198
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
Yes, please, please, please.

199
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,000
(Scanner) I said: \"Thank
you for your input."

200
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,240
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

201
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,360
The car belonged to Henriette Klausen.

202
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,120
Car, Classics, Klausen.
She doesn't just sell cars.

203
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,520
What?
Does she also sell policemen?

204
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Or is that not worth it?

205
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,360
She'll make mincemeat out of you
With dumplings.

206
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,960
*Telephone rings*

207
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,400
I have to go to Mrs. Klausen.
- Who are you?

208
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,680
Maloney, private detective.
- Are you armed?

209
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,080
Only with umbrella, charm and Maloney.

210
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Maloney, private detective.

211
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,960
Great, a real private detective.

212
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Even with a coat.

213
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,600
I'm here about Selina Kaiser.
- And who sent you?

214
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,120
The Holy Ghost.

215
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,120
Why did you give
Selina Kaiser a Porsche?

216
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,920
Mr. Private Detective.

217
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,320
That's not how it works.

218
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,960
Who sent you?

219
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,760
Do you want to frighten me?
- The Schimpfs?

220
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,160
Attack is the best defense.

221
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,640
Mr. Maloney, what
do you want from me?

222
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,440
*Muffled sounds* Oh my
goodness, don't forget to breathe.

223
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
Thank you.

224
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,480
I want to know
why you gave Selina

225
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,280
Kaiser a car shortly
before she was murdered.

226
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Murdered?

227
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,000
Murdered, yes.
- By whom?

228
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,560
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

229
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Yes.

230
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,480
Tell me, why did
you give her a car?

231
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,680
In my private escort club there
was a fire a few months ago.

232
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,280
Luckily no one was hurt, but the

233
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,880
insurance company refused
to cover the damages.

234
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,240
The Schimpfs represented
the insurance company.

235
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,680
Selina found out that they
had suppressed evidence.

236
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,880
She just wanted to help.
- And how?

237
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,720
I only know that she
indulged in this insult.

238
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,200
to obtain documents.
<br>- And now she's dead.

239
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,320
<br>Yes. Life is sometimes tragic.

240
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,440
<br>She was like a sister to me.

241
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,040
<br>A sister, <br> who once
bought something for you?

242
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,520
<br>\"All the sex workers in my club <br>are

243
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,240
self-employed, they only pay <br>for the hotel service.

244
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
" <br>So to speak.

245
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,000
<br>Find out, <br>who murdered Selina.

246
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,040
He's in good company with me.

247
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,720
Bring me back the Porsche,
then there will be more of it.

248
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,400
You lost the case against Mrs.

249
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,240
Klausen.

250
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,839
That's no secret, it's
also in the newspaper.

251
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,960
Do you know why?

252
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
- Because they were lucky.

253
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,320
Mrs.

254
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,600
Kaiser played Mrs.

255
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,160
Klausen evidence that you
had concealed. Ah, okay.

256
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,200
One could have reckoned with that.

257
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Then the mistake is not with us.
- Perhaps it is. Mr. Schimpf had an affair with Mrs. Kaiser. Does Mrs. Klausen claim that?

258
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,040
Do you know by now where your husband is?

259
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,120
I want to talk to him.
- That's not possible.

260
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,120
Either I speak to your
husband or the police.

261
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,320
Both of these I'd rather not
do, but one of them I have to do.

262
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,400
It's not that simple.<br>We
are being watched.

263
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,440
Arrive in 4 hours.
at the end of Grünwilerstrasse.

264
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,880
Why does everyone think,
in this case, that we are in a gangster film?

265
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
* Dull sounds *

266
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,440
My thousands will probably
not make any new friends.

267
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,040
Did it help?

268
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,360
For someone who is so calm
and balanced,

269
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,600
you carry
quite a lot of anger within you.

270
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
Not really.

271
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,000
But I found something
under the passenger seat.

272
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,040
Is your anger directed at
people too, or only at vehicles?

273
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,600
Am I a suspect now?

274
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,680
I loved Selina.

275
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,000
Even when you found out
that she worked as an escort?

276
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
My Selina was a prostitute?

277
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,680
Nowadays one would rather
say sex worker, but yes.

278
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,920
Sex worker?
That's too much for me.

279
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,720
You get used to
new words quickly.

280
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
I need peace now!

281
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,520
(Even if it's only about Marco,
about Marco,

282
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,560
and he's probably
not a good minimalist:

283
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
He's more of a murderer.)

284
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
(And yet Selina is dead.)

285
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
* Screeching brakes *

286
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
I didn't expect you.

287
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,520
I'm probably the only one
not being pursued by the police.

288
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
So? What are we doing here?

289
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,760
Has your father
hidden in a gas chamber?

290
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,880
My father isn't hiding,
he's just on the run, like gas.

291
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,440
Sometimes I wish he would dissolve into thin air.

292
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Come with me.

293
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,360
Did you actually know Mrs. Kaiser well?

294
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Barely.

295
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,520
And what was the relationship
of your parents to her like?

296
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,880
They didn't trust her. 
They trust no one.

297
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Perhaps me, but even then only
because they've known me for so long.

298
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,520
And do you trust your
parents capable of murder?

299
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,880
Do you know why I make art?

300
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,480
Because it wasn't enough for more?

301
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,520
I have been trying for a very long time
to understand who my parents are.

302
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,200
But whenever I look into them,
I only see myself.

303
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
I am slowly understanding

304
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,880
why Schimpf doesn't want him to speak to other people.

305
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,760
Do you know how poison works,
Maloney?

306
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,320
Do you know how to answer questions, Mr. Schimpf?

307
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
What?

308
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,640
Can you trust your parents
to commit murder?

309
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,320
My parents
have murdered me several times.

310
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
Several times.

311
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,120
So, my duty is fulfilled.

312
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,360
You shall walk alone into this hollow alley.

313
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
* Mysterious sounds *

314
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Maloney.

315
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,480
Welcome to my branch.

316
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,160
Mr. Schimpf,
why did you run away?

317
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Please, have a seat.

318
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,560
Can I offer you something?

319
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,880
Why doesn't anyone in this family
actually know

320
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,040
how to answer a question?

321
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,840
Why did you flee,
Mr. Schimpf?

322
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,480
My wife informed me
about your inquiries.

323
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,680
The most important question is:

324
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,080
Who has a motive?
- You.

325
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,240
Do I?

326
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,680
You had an affair
with Selina Kaiser.

327
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,040
She sold information.
That's why you lost the case.

328
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,640
What evidence is there?
- The statement of Mrs.

329
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,520
Klausen. Will Mrs.
Klausen testify in court?

330
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
You were the last one at the crime scene.

331
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,080
The murderer was the
last one at the crime scene.

332
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
What is with this affair?

333
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
The affair ...

334
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
... does not exist!

335
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,560
That's a figment of
the imagination of the

336
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,760
police officers who read
too many trash novels.

337
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,320
By the way, don't you think,
that I am too old for Selina?

338
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,640
Your wife suspects you of the affair.

339
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,320
And you don't believe me either.

340
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,360
What I believe, doesn't
play a big role here.

341
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,520
Will more money help?
- You can try it.

342
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,440
Who is the murderer?
- All signs point to you.

343
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,840
Don't you have any other
clues or something like that?

344
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,520
Who does this belong to?
- Perhaps the murderer.

345
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
That doesn't fit.

346
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,440
Will you tell the police where I am?
- Maybe tomorrow.

347
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,000
First I have to sleep on it.

348
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
Mr. Schimpf.

349
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,000
(The longer I
looked at the money,

350
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,200
the less I knew,
<br>what was going on. )

351
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,720
(And who speaks the truth.)

352
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
* Ringing *

353
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Maloney,
Schimpf confessed and said

354
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,760
he's Selina's killer. Come!

355
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,800
And he just turned himself in?

356
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,040
Questions
will be answered after the interrogation.

357
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Here.

358
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,480
Listen, watch, learn.

359
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,760
You have to concentrate now.
- Yes, it ...

360
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,480
It is important, that you say
everything into the microphone.

361
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,680
So, please identify
yourself for the record.

362
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,200
Theres Schimpf.
- And Hans Schimpf.

363
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,600
So. From the beginning: What is
your relationship to Mrs. Kaiser?

364
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,880
My client had a
relationship with Mrs. Kaiser.

365
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,360
I thought we loved each other.
- That happens in every couple.

366
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,600
Not with me.
- Then with your wife.

367
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,840
Why did you
kill Mrs. Kaiser?

368
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,360
I found out that she was selling insider information and confronted her.

369
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,240
- He was angry.

370
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,360
Angry?
- I said I would report her.

371
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,440
Then she attacked me.

372
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,680
My client couldn't have expected that.

373
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,720
I defended myself and pushed her away.
- An act of passion.

374
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,120
Anyone would do that. Wouldn't you?

375
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,480
Now comes the twist:
He didn't kill her at all.

376
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,000
It was an accident, self-defense.

377
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,400
Then she stumbled
against Albrecht's sculpture.

378
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,080
A part fell on her head,
then I carried her to the office.

379
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,640
Then I saw that she was dead.

380
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,080
My client panicked and disappeared.

381
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,880
When I was clear-headed
again, I presented myself.

382
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,240
My client is a victim himself.

383
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,920
So, should you have no further questions,

384
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,360
we would like to end the interrogation.

385
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,320
The interrogation is over, you can go.

386
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,400
It wasn't murder at all.
- Now we have to be quick.

387
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
Why? - Watch and learn.

388
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,360
The gentleman wants to see
your artwork again, privately.

389
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,080
What do you see?

390
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,200
At first I saw my mother, but now ...

391
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,640
Now I see a goddess of steel.

392
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,320
We humans worship her,
and there are the lifelines.

393
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,440
The lifelines of our ancestors.

394
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,920
This is all very, very confused and messy

395
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,120
and at the same time very,
very simple and simple.

396
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Confused and simple - there
someone looked in the mirror.

397
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,080
Yes, and then of course
climate change, yes!

398
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,640
And finally the deep,
deep, deep loss of all of us.

399
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Very exciting.

400
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Oh, look here.

401
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,440
Is that yours?

402
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,040
Yes, I haven't seen it for ages. Thank you.

403
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,360
All right.
- What do you see in this artwork?

404
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,840
I see a woman who had
an affair with an artist.

405
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,760
He really loved her very much.

406
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,760
She gave him the feeling
that he was a great artist.

407
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,320
But she only wanted to get
at the secret of his parents.

408
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,120
You know a lot about art,
Maloney.

409
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,520
His parents are two
very well-known lawyers.

410
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
Ah, like the Schimpfs?
- Exactly.

411
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Ah.

412
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,800
And it wasn't
Mr. Schimpf who had an

413
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
affair with Mrs. Kaiser,
but his son, Albrecht.

414
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,080
Technically speaking
also a Mr. Schimpf.

415
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,240
But why did he
then kill Mrs. Kaiser?

416
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Ask him yourself.

417
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,800
Why did you kill Mrs. Kaiser?

418
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,040
I loved Selina.

419
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,840
You say nothing.
We refuse to testify.

420
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,680
This is a private room.
- But ... - You say nothing!

421
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,840
Our client refuses to testify.

422
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,360
I am not your client.
- I'm taking down your service number.

423
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,760
Did I pay too little?
- Our client ...

424
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,520
I am not your
client, I am your son!

425
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,840
Quiet. Quiet!

426
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,760
Quiet! Now there must be quiet!

427
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,960
Whoever interrupts, will
be shot dead on the spot.

428
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,360
So?

429
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,240
She was the only one who
saw something in my art.

430
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,880
I thought that anyway. Or
she wanted me to think that.

431
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Thoughts are strange things.

432
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,520
When my parents lost the case, I

433
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,240
realised Selina had only used me.

434
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,280
She ended the relationship
and laughed at my art.

435
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,280
I broke off a piece
and hit her on the head.

436
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,120
Yes, and why did you
say it was self-defense?

437
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,360
I refuse to make a statement.
- I showed Mr.

438
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,480
Schimpf the ring.

439
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,800
He knew it belonged to his
son and wanted to protect him.

440
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,800
Mr. Albrecht Schimpf, you are under arrest.

441
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
You have the right to an attorney.

442
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,280
- I waive that right. Come along. (Some children suffer
because they don't get enough from their parents.)

443
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,720
(Others go to pieces from
an overdose of parents.)

444
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,000
Do you want to take me in your arms again?

445
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,160
*Unintelligible* (Obviously

446
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
there are people who blame

447
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,480
me for the broken Porsche.)

448
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
* Dull sounds *

449
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Thank you.

450
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,360
(Ultimately, less
is simply just less.)

451
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,960
(There are always a thousand reasons
to feel bad.)

452
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,440
(All the love in the world doesn't help)

453
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
That's how it is.
