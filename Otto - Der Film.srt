00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:03,958
We already have one.

317
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,458
We've already had one.

318
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,042
Funny, come up!

319
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,917
(Loud staircase climbing)

320
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:18,208
(Turkish trumpet)

321
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,417
-Oh, dear lady...</br>
-No, thank you, I don't read magazines.

322
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,292
-Are you not aware, that tomorrow is the deadline?
-What's that all about?

323
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,542
Yes, tomorrow is the deadline.

324
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,375
From then on, slavery is
prohibited in our country.

325
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,000
-Did you know that?
-No.

326
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:34,917
-So you also don't have slaves?

327
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:38,042
<br>-No, where are they from?
<br>-From the Erzeugerland,

328
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:41,500
Then there would also be transport
costs, plus customs, plus insurance...

329
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,292
No, thank you,
that's not on the table.

330
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,167
I'm busy at home, and my husband
is at the ministry during the day.

331
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:49,833
Well, there's still the middleman trade,
that would be much cheaper for you.

332
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,500
- Is that cheaper for me?
- Yes, I'll make you an offer.

333
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,208
(Click sounds)

334
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,875
Has the master been called?

335
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,875
That's him, Bimbo.

336
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,583
What does he cost?

337
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:06,875
Noble lady, we'll discuss that
later, I'll show you Bimbo here.

338
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,958
Bimbo, this is your new
mistress, don't make me ashamed.

339
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,375
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye, Master.

340
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,958
Please, if you want to
come closer, Herr...Herr Äh...

341
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,667
Bimbo.
-Thanks, Missis.

342
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,792
Do you want to quit?
Oh, that doesn't pay off.

343
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,458
Yes, then come Please go on.

344
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,708
What are we going to do now?

345
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:31,167
You need to know that
we've never had a slave.

346
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,125
A bit unusual it is, though.

347
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,833
Can I offer you a
coffee? Thank you, Missis.

348
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:41,417
How do you drink your coffee?
-I like it black.

349
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,708
Oh, of course.

350
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,500
I should have thought of
that. \u003ci>(Door is ringing)</i>

351
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,167
<i>The echoes of Turkish doorbells</i>

352
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,917
Good day, are
you holding slaves?

353
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,875
Yes, ah, he's here.

354
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,667
But trade is still<br>allowed
until tomorrow.

355
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,958
Yes, that's right.<br >Is he indeed
registered, the slave, or?

356
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,042
I don't know...

357
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,042
Are you registered, Mr. Bimbo?

358
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:08,792
I'm not registered, Miss.

359
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,375
(Softly) Oh my goodness.

360
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,417
What are we doing
now? No problem.

361
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,333
Then we will report him
here, To that I am present.

362
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:17,083
Pay the same amount:
1,000 Deutsche Marks.

363
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,833
What?

364
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,958
Also, I didn't have that much.

365
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:24,083
I haven't come to
the bank today yet.

366
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,917
I don't know how
much you have there.

367
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,917
-100 Marks.
<br>-That's enough, I'll take it as a deposit.

368
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,792
I am just no monster.

369
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,292
Does that go with it?
And what about the rest?

370
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,208
You pay later. Bimbo comes with me, as a deposit.

371
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,667
Ah, that's very nice of you.

372
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:40,875
Mr. Bimbo, don't you want
to drink their coffee first?

373
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,833
I must go, missis, I must go.

374
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:44,417
Goodbye.

375
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,875
See you soon.

376
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,375
This is your share.

377
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,167
What do you actually
need the money for?

378
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,958
For some blackness.
-Not again!

379
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:01,000
Birdsong

380
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,417
(Happy, light
instrumental music)

381
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,208
(electric humming
of the opening gate)

382
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:12,458
<i>Actually, she opened
all the doors, my new fly.</i>

383
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,417
<i>That was it, the
Kingdom of the Rich.</i>

384
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,708
<i>Now they should know
how strong an arm is.</i>

385
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:24,250
<i>I had saved my life with the luxury
cement sack now it was their turn.</i>

386
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,250
<i>My God, I was
again for sale today.</i>

387
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,958
<i>I would have even
sold my soul for money.</i>

388
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,625
We're not buying anything, we have
everything. That's just fine, I'm invited.

389
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:38,208
Your card, please?
-Karte?

390
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,667
Mixed noise.

391
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,792
<i>Come in, bring money in.</i>

392
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,625
I will inform you of the
monarchies, Herr...Sir Seven.

393
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:22,125
Chattering

394
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:28,667
Cash laughs, unknown master.
-Since you're here, it's nice.

395
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,167
Harp music.

396
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:37,833
(Sighing)

397
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,792
Water gurgling You are young.

398
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,250
<i>You are in love.</i>

399
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,708
<i>You need glasses.</i>

400
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:48,958
<i>My friend,</i>

401
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:52,958
How I am eager to gaze into the open
and noble aspects of that man's character.

402
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,083
The thing most precious that has been
saved for me, what I possess on earth.

403
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,708
My Sylvia.

404
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,500
Give me your hand.

405
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,667
Are you giving me something? I
think I'm supposed to get something!

406
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,292
I thought of cash, a gift?

407
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,333
<i>The consul has called me.</i>

408
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,625
<i>Where is my reward?</i>

409
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,792
Speaks French.

410
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:20,458
Signed, Jean, from the best. And from
the most expensive, Château Reitbach 1899.

411
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,292
Just in time for the
rescuer! (Tinkling bell rings)

412
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:34,542
Oh, Christmas! Ottilie,
merry Christmas!

413
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:37,042
Why doesn't anyone sing along?
Ah yes, I'm the one who gets it.

414
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,417
Hello-ditty!

415
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:43,292
Coughing

416
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,333
We have been thinking
for a long time over.

417
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:49,583
how one can thank a savior,

418
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:53,208
The elevation of its
high position raises it.

419
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:55,875
Over selfish,
financial interests.

420
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,542
Money, as we had said,

421
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,375
Can't mean anything
for a man like that.

422
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:06,250
We have therefore
decided on a gift.

423
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:07,958
Yes?

424
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,042
My God, then take it already.

425
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:15,083
Yes, but where is it, though?

426
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,167
Scratching wailing noises.

427
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,958
Where did you
hide it?<br>Where is it?

428
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,208
There!

429
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:24,875
Is that it?

430
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,250
The gift?

431
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,542
I can't accept this.

432
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:30,958
I can't assume this is all of it?

433
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,125
My dear Silvia.

434
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,917
Today shall not only be blessed
the Saviour, but also the Saved.

435
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,208
<i>Rescued ones</i>

436
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:42,958
For there is no savior
without those who are saved.

437
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,958
And as happily Rescued
ones,<br>you will also do well to practice

438
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,667
Better watch out for them eight.

439
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,583
And so you will
live for all eternity,

440
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,750
This ringlet reminds me.

441
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:58,250
Toy music

442
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,583
But Ernesto.

443
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:04,708
It must have cost a fortune.

444
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:08,833
Not worth mentioning, $96.50.

445
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,458
<i>There it was, the solution
to my three problems.</i>

446
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,292
<i>But I had already
gotten three new ones.</i>

447
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,417
They stood there,
I had to let her go,

448
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,375
<i>The dumb thing was that they
wanted me to get rid of them.</i>

449
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,833
I'm looking forward to
your slideshow presentation.

450
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,708
-They want to go now safely.
-Ah, they're already leaving?

451
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,083
Can we also look at
the slides together?

452
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,208
Yes, yes, Diass,
Diass, Good days!

453
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:35,167
<i>I want to show you with these
pictures a glimpse of my homeland.</i>

454
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,500
<i>You also will soon
be my, my love Silvia.</i>

455
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:39,292
<i>My private airplane.</i>

456
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:44,250
<i>My first Jaguar.</i>

457
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,333
<i>My second Jaguar.</i>

458
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,333
<i>My servant.</i>

459
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,542
<i>And lastly, my mother.</i>

460
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:59,333
Clapping hands.
Bravo, Ernesto, bravo!

461
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,458
Wonderful days.

462
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:04,500
Ah, I brought a photo along,<br>if
you ever want to take a look.

463
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:07,458
No, thank you. We don't
want to put up with you.

464
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,250
I would also like to
see that, it interests me.

465
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,333
Yes?

466
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,208
That which I have, love.
- What?

467
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:15,875
This is my bicycle. Look
at it, how it's jumping up.

468
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:17,875
Wiehern

469
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:20,792
I was the only one who could
hold the saddle for 40 seconds.

470
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:22,458
I came to myself
again in the hospital.

471
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:24,667
I was, of course, the
only one, who came to me,

472
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,250
when you don't do
everything yourself...

473
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:28,833
Look at that bicycle, here.

474
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:31,208
My father went to the lake,
to teach me how to swim.

475
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:33,792
He threw me into the water,
while the others skated.

476
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:37,792
Look at that bike!<br>/that
you have to have seen.

477
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:40,333
Behind is our farm, which was
quite small; we were very poor.

478
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,500
We were so poor, we had only a
sheep, and that was 50% Synthetic.

479
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:46,292
Silvia, it's time to think about,
that we have to go to the opera.

480
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,417
My little singing thrush.
-Yes!

481
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,333
<i>Then we want to go, all
of us, all of us, all of us go.</i>

482
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:59,125
Yes, it only goes into your
opera,<br>listen to the melodies,

483
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:02,500
Intoxicate yourselves with the
air, love yourselves in the loges.

484
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:07,542
-What are you doing there?<br>
-Oh, um, I thought you were going.

485
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:11,542
You're right, why people listen in
other's houses,<br> You have me too!

486
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,250
The guitar and the sea.

487
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:16,167
and the joy that you now
have the right to wish for.

488
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:18,917
I wish you would leave
my house immediately.

489
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,542
I don't know that song.

490
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:25,958
Don't you see that I'm utterly exhausted?
 -I'll just sing my lullaby right away!

491
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,625
Oh God...
- You can tell Otto that I'm fine.

492
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,083
Don't fall asleep, first let's sing
the sheep song! (Guitar music...).

493
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:36,500
The first sheep was named
Friedrich; that was incredibly low.

494
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:40,917
The second sheep was named
Peach, because she used to screech.

495
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,750
The third sheep was called John,
stayed on Peach all day long.

496
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,708
The 306th sheep was named Eberhard;<br>drank so much, his liver was hard.

497
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:56,958
The 307th sheep was called
Luke,<br>he always had to puke...

498
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:02,542
Erm, that's 720. The sheep was called Gertrull,
because one hits its head on the skull.

499
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:07,417
The sheep was called Vin;
because one likes to pull it's chin...

500
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:12,167
The 990th sheep was called
Trump,<br>the lightning hit his rump.

501
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:18,917
The 1000th sheep was named Harold,
and that was a hundred years old...

502
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:22,542
Guitar feedback
during recording.

503
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,375
Harold!

504
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,292
Snoring.

505
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:32,458
Xylophone music

506
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:34,542
Now let's go, attack!

507
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,375
Stop my friend, that's injustice!
-Ah, Nonsense!

508
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,625
Snap up the ring<br>and
get out of here!

509
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,708
But not with the ring.
-What else?

510
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:45,208
With good conscience.
-Is that how he intends to pay off his debts?

511
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:47,542
It's better to have
debts than to be liable.

512
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,292
Slander, nothing but slander.
-Those are not slanders.

513
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,083
Are you kidding
me?<br> No, not at all.

514
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,208
But! -No!

515
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,083
But! - No! (Loud clinking.)

516
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:01,458
Loud guitar noise Harald!

517
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,042
<i>I was richer tonight.</i>

518
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:16,083
<i>Wealth in experience,
That has been done well.</i>

519
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:18,708
<i>and resist the
influences of evil.</i>

520
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,250
<i>Dear debts, have become guilty.</i>

521
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,750
<i>Those were not just
golden words, that was...</i>

522
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,875
What the hell! It was
a massive shitshow.

523
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:30,125
If I had the ring, I'd get out of
everything, what an idiot, what a twit!

524
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,833
I'm a shit, now I have to
earn money with honest work.

525
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:34,167
Angry outbursts.

526
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,417
Happy music

527
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,292
startled summons

528
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:06,042
Joyful music.

529
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:18,958
(loud big band music) (Otto
makes suitable drum tones)

530
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,667
Louder scream

531
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:30,125
<i>I would never have thought that
honest work could be so dangerous.</i>

532
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:34,792
<i>One must warn people, their lives at stake
by setting it on the line with honest work.</i>

533
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:38,583
<i>Was there no law that protects
people from honest work?</i>

534
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,833
<i>No! There was only one
place, where one could be safe.</i>

535
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,833
<i>The walls of my own home.</i>

536
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:46,750
The door slams shut.

537
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,083
Ominous music

538
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,083
What's your success?

539
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:54,750
Success? Ahm...

540
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:58,042
Now, since I want to ask, what
do you understand by "success"?

541
00:32:58,292 --> 00:32:59,333
I'll ask something simpler.

542
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:01,667
What do you see under a bridge?

543
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:03,292
Can you imagine
nothing under that?

544
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:06,417
No large white steamer,<br>with
a big naked woman?

545
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:09,875
Also nice, something
lighter,</br>ahm ah ah...</br>

546
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,708
What do you mean by a bridge?

547
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:16,083
Nothing, because the big steamship is so
loud shouting,<br>with the beautiful naked woman.

548
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:18,542
Do you know what I understand?

549
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:20,667
Loud coughing. I want my money!

550
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,917
98 shillings and fifty pence.

551
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:27,708
Yes, but you already have
50 cents.<br /(Phone rings)

552
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:31,625
Hello?

553
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:33,625
No.

554
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:35,583
Huh?

555
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:38,500
That's what I will tell him.

556
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:40,083
Tomorrow.

557
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:44,167
Auf Wiedersehen,<br>Miss
von Kohlen and Reibach.

558
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:51,500
Good luck, little one.

559
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,208
I hear now, you forgot
something,<br>in the park alley.

560
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,667
Your gift. My gift? Ah, my gift.

561
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:00,792
It's quite valuable, I hear.

562
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:04,583
Yes yes, valuable, it's extremely
valuable, I'm going right away and get it.

563
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:08,583
A heavier blow than the knife
blade into the doorframe hits

564
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:13,875
Tomorrow is the last day.

565
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:16,375
(Fateful Music)

566
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:19,292
(Hitting the door)

567
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:25,292
(The motor of the car makes
noise, runs on too few cylinders)

568
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:36,542
-Stop, I am innocent!
-But that is your problem!

569
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:38,958
Amusing. (Makes baby noises.)

570
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:43,375
Bottle, huh? \u003ci>Silvia,
aren't you leaving?</i>

571
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:47,875
I'm sorry, but I
can't help with that.

572
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,250
Weidenmann's Healing, Ernesto.

573
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,125
Weidmann's thanks.
Yes, it only hunts your wild.

574
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,792
It kills with bare rifles, Shoots
at everything that moves.

575
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:00,667
We have been making
this bottle for so long, yes?

576
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,083
Is that a good suggestion?

577
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:05,417
That's an unmitigated nerve!
Silvia, you're coming with!

578
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:08,875
But Mum, you know,<br>how sad
it is for me to mistreat animals.

579
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:13,667
-Sylvia! You're climbing now!
-And you, Your Ladyship?

580
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,250
Mr. Otto?

581
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:17,500
Yes? - I'll ride with you!

582
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,125
Yes, but where then?

583
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:21,958
To the hunt!

584
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:24,208
Is this for the hunt? That's
my world! Ships Ahoy!

585
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:27,292
Peter Heil! The mountain is calling,<br>all
come up, neck and ankle break!

586
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:32,708
Aeolus sighing of
the Ferrari engine.

587
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:36,875
<i>She ran off, the
beautiful daughter.</i>

588
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:40,333
<i>But the way to the daughter's
heart goes over her mother's ear!</i>

589
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:42,958
<i>And all mothers of this
world<br>understand the language of music!</i>

590
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:46,333
Radio noises, then music

591
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,250
Song "My little green
cactus" (Otto sings along)

592
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,208
<i>Hail, whorls, whirlpools!</i>

593
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:55,708
<i>I need red roses, I
need red poppies.</i>

594
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:58,750
<i>Hollari, Hollari, Hollaro!</i>

595
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:02,250
<i>And if a wicked one<br> what
untoward words speaks,</i>

596
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:05,208
<i>Then I'll take my cactus,
and it pricks, pricks, pricks.</i>

597
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:08,625
<i>My little green cactus<br>stands
outside on the balcony,</i>

598
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,667
<i>Hollar, hollar, Hollar!</i>

599
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:15,833
<i>Pik, pik, pik, pik, pik...</i>

600
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:22,042
<i>Today at four,
knock on the door.</i>

601
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:25,417
<i>What a surprise visit
so early in the day.</i>

602
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:28,708
<i>It was Mr. Krause
from next door.</i>

603
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:31,958
<i>He says: "Excuse me, if I ask:</i>

604
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:35,083
<i>She has a cactus
on her small balcony.</i>

605
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:38,542
<i>Hollar, hollar, Holaro!</i>

606
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:42,292
<i>I don't know what
to make of that.</i>

607
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:45,250
Hail, hallo, hello!

608
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:48,583
<i>It fell upon my face,
whether you believe it or not.</i>

609
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:51,667
<i>Now I know that your small
green cactus pricked me.</i>

610
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,917
<i>Please move your
cactus politely elsewhere.</i>

611
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:58,458
<i>Hollari, Hollari, Hollaro!</i>

612
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,542
<i>Dear woodland companions,
and woodland maidens,</i>

613
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:10,333
<i>We are here again this year,</i>

614
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,458
<i>I have come together
in my territory.</i>

615
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:15,958
<i>to make it thoroughly.</i>

616
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,875
He is,<br> Rudolf, the rammer.

617
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:24,042
of all the capital and most criminal,
of all the roughest and most cunning,

618
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:27,458
of all things, and
most detestable,

619
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:29,792
the strongest and
proudest of them all.

620
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:32,167

00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,125
Two things are we
here absolutely not:

778
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:21,583
People like you,

779
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:24,167
And people who look like you.

780
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,542
<i>Ask him the question already.</i>

781
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:28,917
(Whistling)

782
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,708
How does an Eskimo
go to the bathroom?

783
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,167
<i>I don't know how
an Eskimo defecates.</i>

784
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:37,458
(Ice cubes crunching)

785
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:52,167
( Otto laughs loudly )

786
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:54,750
Spitzenwitz! Shithole!

787
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:57,542
I can't translate that for you.

788
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,583
Werner, one more question.

789
00:48:00,792 --> 00:48:04,750
Change is invisible and
smells of rabbit, what is that?

790
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:09,750
What is invisible
and smells of rabbit.

791
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:12,250
Is a rabbit's poop?

792
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,458
Loud applause

793
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:17,917
Rock music plays again.

794
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:39,833
Ah, that's it,</br>the
Créme de la Créme.

795
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,542
Thank you, old man!<br>Hot oven.

796
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:44,708
Hehehe!

797
00:48:48,042 --> 00:48:50,625
Classical Baroque
music in the background.

798
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:02,125
Hickson

799
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,208
Apologies.

800
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:04,583
Do you know this?

801
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:08,958
What is it, it is
invisible,<br>and smells of rabbit.

802
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:11,208
A rabbit's fart!

803
00:49:12,542 --> 00:49:14,500
loud laughter

804
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:19,042
Silvia!

805
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,000
Silvia, Silvia, you!

806
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,625
Oh dear heaven.

807
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:30,125
Respected friends,

808
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:32,583
I have the
extraordinary pleasure,

809
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:36,042
Meet him with this very
ordinary, young man.

810
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:38,250
the had the unusual luck.

811
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:41,125
My daughter Silvia,
that's what it's all about.

812
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:42,917
Sir Otto?
Ja?

813
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:45,083
Mr. Obermayor, Mehlig.

814
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:48,625
Oh, a man of faith.

815
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:51,083
Wonderful,<br >then you
are certainly the one,

816
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:53,375
Who can help me
during my faith crisis?

817
00:49:53,542 --> 00:49:56,500
So it is possible for me, young friend.
-I believe namely,

818
00:49:56,625 --> 00:49:59,625
I'm getting nothing
more to drink.

819
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,542
I'm getting
something,<br> a wonder!

820
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,417
Moni, where are you?<br>
I'll beat you at dominoes.

821
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,125
Lead singer,<br>
Anneliese Grünentaler.

822
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:10,667
Mrs. Opera Singer,
Do you sing here?

823
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,750
I can shatter
glass,./Please be careful.

824
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:16,375
(Hashed, Dog Bells)

825
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:18,500
Not full yet, wait a moment.

826
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,667
(Screaming) (Glass clinking)

827
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:23,042
Do you see?

828
00:50:23,208 --> 00:50:26,083
It works. And
here is a friend of Ernesto,

829
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,583
General Gustavo Raul Stussner

830
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:29,833
General Stossner!

831
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:31,083
(military salute)

832
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:32,250
Well?

833
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:35,583
This beauty, and so much lametta.
- What's this?

834
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:38,417
A Christmas tree,
that can speak.

835
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:42,458
At your doorstep still clings the blood,
the blood of your slaughtered enemies.

836
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:45,917
But since we're just talking about war
now, can I get something to drink, or what?

837
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,833
Thank you, You can leave now!

838
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:51,750
This gentleman
knows you already.

839
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:56,208
Bodo, Prince of Markwitz.
-I know you, but do you know this place?

840
00:50:56,667 --> 00:50:58,917
If you recognize this animal,

841
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:01,125
Now I may have a head
of hair drink your champagne.

842
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:03,292
And?

843
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:06,083
- Pig!
- I'll just let that go.

844
00:51:07,292 --> 00:51:10,292
No one understands me, but
Ernesto, you understand me.

845
00:51:10,792 --> 00:51:12,917
What's wrong?

846
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:16,417
No one understands me.

847
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:17,750
No one.

848
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:19,875
Otto is mumbling.

849
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:24,167
I have to tell you, you...
-Enough, you've said enough!

850
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:27,667
Dear friends, let us
now come to dessert.

851
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,625
But I must tell her anyway!

852
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:31,542
Silvia, you...</br>-Enough!

853
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:35,792
-The dessert, please.
-The dessert, where does it come from?

854
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,208
Oh, the dessert.

855
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:40,417
<i>A small moment, I do that...</i>

856
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,917
Apples of Bordell,
Potato Fritters.

857
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:50,750
We have, we had, He is gone
now, he is completely gone.

858
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:52,167
Where is he now?

859
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:53,958
Ah, there he is.

860
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:55,958
And with Red.

861
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:57,667
Oh, it's just too little.

862
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,750
We'll just take a
"Loni pot" instead.

863
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:01,125
Explosion.

864
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:06,042
God, stand by us!
(Singer cries out singing)

865
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,833
<i>No panic! No panic!</i>

866
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,917
Women and Otti first!

867
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:14,375
Excited cries from
the restaurant.

868
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:24,458
(The auto door slams)
(The car speeds off quickly)

869
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:30,833
Caution, sir!

870
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:38,708
My friend, no one
should sink so deep.

871
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:41,417
that he is the most
beautiful gift of nature

872
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,917
In his rage he throws himself.

873
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:46,583
and if you really want the wine,

874
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:48,708
and now and just,

875
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:52,917
I am willing to help.

876
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:55,208
This is rubbish wine, that
doesn't have a screw-top.

877
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:58,458
But but, here come.

878
00:52:58,667 --> 00:53:01,167
We have indeed brought
everything,<br>everything with us.

879
00:53:04,542 --> 00:53:09,083
People say that Crème de la Crème
has left something behind lately.

880
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:10,708
How were you satisfied?

881
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:13,708
What did you have for supper?

882
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:17,542
-I'm annoyed, nothing but annoyance.
-I'm annoyed, yes, but not that much.

883
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:20,583
We are indeed cultivated people.

884
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:25,000
We wouldn't be here if not for that.
-Aah.

885
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:27,542
Thank you.

886
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:30,208
(Satisfied sigh)

887
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:40,250
I had at the time (wine brand)

888
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:43,875
And (another wine brand)
is highly appreciated.

889
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:47,667
I love you, I love you, <br>the little French girls.

890
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:49,875
Both laugh.

891
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:54,375
-(French) To your health!
-Tea, I thought there was wine here.

892
00:53:56,125 --> 00:54:00,875
And what a wine!<br>
that is a Bordeaux.

893
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,792
Castle Reibach.

894
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:04,708
This is a year

895
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:08,125
Gurgling sounds

896
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:10,000
1902

897
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,792
Hmm? Yes, or?

898
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,458
No idea.

899
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:17,333
1901.

900
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:21,458
No, that can't possibly be true.

901
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:24,083
<i>It's 1899.</i>

902
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:28,500
Ah, that my old tongue<br>can
still experience it.

903
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:35,417
That there is
still this wine left.

904
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:37,667
Do you know what this wine is?

905
00:54:37,917 --> 00:54:40,958
At the last auction in
Bordeaux where was brought?

906
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:45,917
96.6 Mark, and if I'm not wrong,

907
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:47,917
Fifty cents.

908
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:49,625
(Pronounced)

909
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,000
<i>In this night I had a dream,</i>

910
00:54:58,083 --> 00:55:00,417
<i>I will be ashamed
for as long as I live.</i>

911
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:03,542
<i>A luck that will never
be known by anyone.</i>

912
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:05,208
<i>This went like this:</i>

913
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:07,417
Cymbal crashes

914
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:11,458
<i>The Line Fleet,
Carthage-Constantinople.</i>

<i>I'm hacking full throttle,<br>and
behind me my brother Ernesto.</i>

916
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:19,250
<i>And what does he do?</i>

917
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,167
<i>That must be different.</i>

918
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:24,792
<i>The rubbing.</i>

919
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,833
Who was it?

920
00:55:26,917 --> 00:55:28,000
Whip cracks

921
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:34,000
<i>That must be a poor
slave, who never had to row.</i>

922
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:38,833
<i>It has never fallen to rowing...</i>

923
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:39,958
Groaning.

924
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:42,167
Never again Castle Reibach.

925
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:47,417
What! Is it 12:73?

926
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:50,083
<i>There they were,
my three problems.</i>

927
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:53,875
<i>I had a hangover, a rabbit.</i>

928
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:56,250
<i>And I was totally weak.</i>

929
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:58,583
<i>And this, of all
days,<br>the day of decision.</i>

930
00:55:58,917 --> 00:56:01,250
<i>He or I. She or
none. How or what.</i>

931
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,000
<i>What was there, was just a
intensified fitness program.</i>

932
00:56:04,417 --> 00:56:07,292
One hundred and one...(Sighs)

One hundred and three.

One hundred and four, one hundred

Three thousand sixteen, three thousand seventeen

00:56:42,417 --> 00:56:45,250
(Cutting sounds)

939
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:50,250
(breaking bottles)

940
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:55,208
<i>Only one strength breakfast, and I was
ready for the battle of love and happiness.</i>

941
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:58,167
<i>The world should now know me.</i>

942
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:04,042
Joyful flute music.

943
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,458
<i>Nothing should
now stand in my way.</i>

944
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:29,458
Spray sounds.

945
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:35,375
(mysterious music)

946
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:46,875
<i>Wailing sirens</i>

947
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:55,333
Fire! Fire!<br> (loud coughing)

948
00:58:01,917 --> 00:58:03,625
(Soft coughing)

949
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:11,125
Drill sound.

950
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,833
Very good eye measurement.

951
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:22,542
Yes, for a marriage loan, you
need security, do you have security?

952
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,958
Security? Ah, well, if she
wants it, I'm unsure, but

953
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:27,250
That I want, am I
sure? No, heart by side.

954
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:30,417
What I mean are
material securities, stocks.

955
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:32,583
Real estate, bonds.

956
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:36,875
I have many deposit bottles, but...
-This is an attack!

957
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:38,792
First comes...
-Hands up!

958
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:41,958
Axis, this is an invasion!
<br>-All down!

959
00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:47,667
You're not, you idiot.

960
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,583
We have been spelling
it wrong for years.

961
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:51,625
For you always<br >still
Mr. Haenlein,

962
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,875
Sir, Sir Haenlein.
- Also good, Sir Haenlein.

963
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:58,750
Now get moving with your 93
kilos and hand over the money.

964
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:02,042
I apologize but I can
not fulfil your request.

965
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:06,083
And secondly, it seems
to me, with your 1 meter 9?

966
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:09,417
exactly suitable for, to
overcome this obstacle.

967
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:13,167
Mr. Haenlein, even your
blue-grey eyes must have noticed,

968
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,250
that a war injury does not prevent someone
under the age of approximately 45 from

969
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:17,792
Such turn exercises
here to make.

970
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:22,583
Oh, don't be so dramatic,<br>with
that 5cm long scar under your eye.

971
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:28,167
What am I supposed to say about my
good, but bothersome speech faults?

972
00:59:28,292 --> 00:59:29,708
Also good.

973
00:59:29,917 --> 00:59:32,042
The clever one gives in.
- Yes.

974
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:39,958
Ominous music

975
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,375
Bank employee
makes siren noises.

976
00:59:58,125 --> 00:59:59,208
Foolish fog!

977
01:00:00,917 --> 01:00:03,417
Exactly 98.65 DM!

978
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:06,708
Mr. Haenlein, you are bringing
this suitcase, into my social housing.

979
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:08,958
Thomas Ballermann Street 50.

980
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:11,125
And that was with
the stolen Mercedes.

981
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:15,917
with the fake number plates
they had forged, SF-FN 222,

982
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,792
Such a piece of
cruelty from you!

983
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:19,458
Get out of the way of this pair.

984
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:23,625
But not like that. Yes,
how else would it be?

985
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:25,542
Yes, put it on or
push or shove it.

986
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:27,458
Or do you believe,<br>it
will sort itself out?

987
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:29,500
Look, it's going its own way.

988
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,250
Please, Mr. Sonnemann.

989
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:36,833
We'll meet tomorrow, punctually
at 9:15 am on the plane.

990
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:40,958
I wait in the one after Rio de Janeiro,
and not in the one after Southeast Asia.

991
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:43,125
You sadistic beast!
(Police sirens)

992
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:47,292
Ah, 9: 15 am, Rio de Janeiro,
and not Southeast Asia.

993
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:51,167
loud police sirens.

994
01:00:52,167 --> 01:00:53,667
(Tires squeaking)

995
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:57,042
Hands up! No movement!

996
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:59,500
Peterson, you as an old
brush-tailed squirrel must see,<br>

997
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:01,958
They are paper camels.

998
01:01:02,042 --> 01:01:04,083
Man, who can't
even lift their hands.

999
01:01:04,417 --> 01:01:06,458
But Chef, you can
see that they can.

1000
01:01:08,292 --> 01:01:09,583
Come on out already!

1001
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,917
Comrade Inspector,<br> I have
everything under control.

1002
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:15,375
I will give you a complete
description of the perpetrator.

1003
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:17,083
Write down, Petersen.

1004
01:01:18,417 --> 01:01:20,125
Now, get on with it.

1005
01:01:20,583 --> 01:01:22,125
The one,

1006
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:24,000
That was a half chicken.

1007
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:26,958
and had something
peculiar under his left eye.

1008
01:01:27,875 --> 01:01:30,708
A forged license plate, with
a scar on the number plate.

1009
01:01:30,792 --> 01:01:32,708
Should I really lie
down with you, boss?

1010
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:35,292
The second was
Thomas Ballermann.

1011
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:39,500
And had a language error, South-East
Asia, around 9:15 am, in Rio de Janeiro.

1012
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:41,208
I have made a phantom drawing.

1013
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:43,417
Paper bag wriggling;
doesn't it seem clear?

1014
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,333
Now what are you going to say?

1015
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,375
But Inspector,<br>two
robbers came into the bank,

1016
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,042
He is short, he is long.

1017
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:56,500
FS-SF 222, false
registration plate.

1018
01:01:56,583 --> 01:02:00,833
Thomas Ballermann Street, 9:15, in Rio, Call the police now I have it.

1019
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:05,792
<i>Mr. Astrid, weren't you a witness
to this brutal bank robbery?</i>

1020
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:09,542
Do you have any
information for our viewers?

1021
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:11,167
What did you observe?

1022
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:15,208
Do you know, I as a barber?
can tell you something like that:

1023
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:19,375
The robbers won't
have any joy at this heist.

1024
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:22,167
Why?<br>
-I saw them too,

1025
01:02:22,292 --> 01:02:24,792
with their nylon stockings.

1026
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,958
That's poison for your hair.

1027
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:31,958
Hair wants to breathe. Hair...

1028
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:36,250
Mr. Astrid, I have a question, may
I call you simply over the phone?

1029
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:38,792
-Behind left.<br>
-Behind left, thank you.

1030
01:02:38,917 --> 01:02:41,167
<i>Yes and what about
the getaway car?</i>

1031
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:45,500
<i>I'll tell you one thing, Silvia,
this Mr. Otto you never see again.</i>

1032
01:02:45,917 --> 01:02:48,125
But Mum, he saved my life.

1033
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:49,458
That's bad enough.

1034
01:02:49,542 --> 01:02:52,708
You don't save your life with
people like that in our family.

1035
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:56,083
Something in style I
had expected from you.

1036
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:59,333
But Mother, she
is nice and friendly.

1037
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:04,500
This mixture of Frankenstein and The
Hunchback of Notre Dame is quite nice.

1038
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:07,542
You're unfair,<br>he's not
a monster at all, in fact.

1039
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:11,375
-He sometimes had something of a dancer.
-Dancer?

1040
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:16,583
Dance of the Vampires
maybe.<br>Believe me, the man is criminal.

1041
01:03:16,875 --> 01:03:20,125
This startled glance,<br>
this common grin.

1042
01:03:20,417 --> 01:03:22,000
And have you seen his hands?

1043
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:25,458
Thieves are that! The
hands of born murderer.

1044
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:28,208
You're going too far!
I've seen his hands.

1045
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:33,000
They are the hands of an artist.
Those of a conductor, a pianist.

1046
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:36,042
One guitarist, a
counterfashionist.

1047
01:03:36,542 --> 01:03:39,250
I believe that he can
be infinitely gentle.

1048
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:41,958
Believe what you
want,</br>I know what I know.

1049
01:03:42,292 --> 01:03:45,542
Tomorrow at 9:15 am<br>we'll
be sitting on the plane to Rio.

1050
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:48,958
And tomorrow you are
Ernest's wife, and also...

1051
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:51,667
What are you
doing there, Master?

1052
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:55,167
Yes, what's going on here?

1053
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:59,917
Happy flute music...

1054
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:18,833
<i>There they were again,
my three problems.</i>

1055
01:04:18,917 --> 01:04:20,542
(The door slammed) I loved that girl,

1056
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:22,750
<i>There are only a few
hours left, to win them.</i>

1057
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:24,875
<i>And I didn't know how to do it.</i>

1058
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:26,417
<i>Did my book know that?</i>

1059
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:31,458
The slow method,
winning a woman.

1060
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:35,458
Ah, the quick method,
a woman to win.

1061
01:04:35,542 --> 01:04:38,750
Firstly, greet her with a gift,
Secondly, invite her to dine.

1062
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,583
And thirdly, say that you
want to start a family with her.

1063
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:44,583
Listen to me for a moment.

1064
01:04:46,667 --> 01:04:49,042
<i>Firstly, greet her with a gift.</i>

1065
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,167
Secondly, invite them to dinner.

1066
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,333
And thirdly, tell her that
you want to start a family.

1067
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:54,500
<i>Knocking on Turkish doors</i>

1068
01:04:55,167 --> 01:04:56,542
Harpsichord music.

1069
01:04:57,833 --> 01:05:00,292
(whispers) Say, that you
want to start a family with her.

1070
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:01,708
I want a child from you.

1071
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:04,500
Isn't that a bit too rushed?
(whispering) -Damn it.

1072
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:06,708
Invite them to dinner.

1073
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:08,500
Can I invite you to dinner?

1074
01:05:09,042 --> 01:05:10,375
- With pleasure
- Will I then get a child from you?

1075
01:05:10,542 --> 01:05:12,833
-Let me get in first.
-No, you're getting it mixed up.

1076
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:15,458
The gift comes, here.

1077
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:21,417
That's lovely of you.
-So, and now it's time for dinner.

1078
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:26,417
Who's Otto?

1079
01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:27,542
How's it going?

1080
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:29,583
Acidic cucumbers
with potato salad?

1081
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:31,917
No, no, /today is
the surprise menu.

1082
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:34,833
He is walking into the kitchen.

1083
01:05:39,042 --> 01:05:41,125
As a small surprise, I have

1084
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:44,417
Bullettencocktail
for my friend Otto

1085
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:46,958
And his companion, please.

1086
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:49,625
That's just dreamy,<br>that
I've always wanted.

1087
01:05:52,292 --> 01:05:54,958
- delicious.
- I want to know more about you.

1088
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:57,125
Now drink up first. Have
you ever had a girlfriend?

1089
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:02,208
Friend, that can't be said like
that, that was more of a pen pal.

1090
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,583
I don't know whether
one can say that.

1091
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:04,875
But I'll say it like this,

1092
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,708
That was thus:

1093
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:10,542
<i>She was called Ilse, and
I had written her a letter.</i>

1094
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:12,042
The window creaks.

1095
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:14,542
<i>But she never got him.</i>

1096
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:18,542
Ah, how sad.. Ah, do you
know, there are still others...

1097
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:21,458
Main course! False hare.

1098
01:06:22,792 --> 01:06:25,667
That looks good.
Please. May I, please?

1099
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:28,667
Good luck. And what about Ilse?

1100
01:06:29,167 --> 01:06:30,583
Have you ever tried it again?

1101
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,500
But I've tried it.

1102
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:36,292
I wrote her a long,
long, long letter.

1103
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:38,417
Joyful flute music

1104
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:41,583
<i>It was the longest letter;
that I had ever written.</i>

1105
01:06:41,792 --> 01:06:45,167
<i>I had written down all the weight
of my great love from the heart.</i>

1106
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:49,542
<i>There was already something together,<br>and
everything was contained in this letter.</i>

1107
01:06:49,667 --> 01:06:51,417
And this time I was smarter.

1108
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:54,917
I stuck the letter to,<br>and
had the window open.

1109
01:06:56,667 --> 01:06:59,375
Sounds of ducks Splashing sound

1110
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:05,333
How dreadful! Ah, you know, there
is even more dreadful thing than that.

1111
01:07:05,417 --> 01:07:09,208
And now for dessert. My main
course, Hackfleischpudding.

1112
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:10,833
Thank you very much.

1113
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:14,542
That's also my main course.
Have you tried it by post?

1114
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:16,875
But of course.

1115
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:19,667
Joyful flute music.

1116
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:29,125
<i>But, alas, in some
godforsaken, Dutch post office,</i>

1117
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:31,917
The Tauber Valley
had to happen then.

1118
01:07:32,792 --> 01:07:34,375
<i>The owl is silent.</i>

1119
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:40,083
Ah, Otto. Ah, Silvia.

1120
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:46,958
Stavros, what's up?<br>
Ah, menu is over.

1121
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:49,500
Alright, let's get started.

1122
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:52,125
Goodbye!<br /(Host
responds in a foreign language)

1123
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:55,333
Otto responds in
a foreign language.

1124
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:58,417
The history was so
sad. There is worse.

1125
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:00,458
What?!
-It could rain.

1126
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:01,833
RegergNoise

1127
01:08:01,917 --> 01:08:03,667
How nice that you
have a umbrella with you.

1128
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:04,833
Yes.

1129
01:08:04,917 --> 01:08:06,708
Happy music<br >A raincoat

1130
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:08,833
for you and me.

1131
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,583
Step dance sounds

1132
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:38,625
Why are you crying?
- Otto is raining and I have no umbrella.

1133
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:40,375
Why isn't it raining anymore?

1134
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:43,667
Come's, we're taking the shortcut<br >over
the cemetery, to my place in the warm.

1135
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,625
Do you not fear at all?

1136
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:50,750
-No, not if you're at my place.
-Sounds nice. (loud eagle scream)

1137
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:52,708
So, that's how it goes.

1138
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:55,125
The tree creaks. You, I
have to tell you something.

1139
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,500
I am different than
the others. I know that.

1140
01:08:57,583 --> 01:08:59,792
No no,<br> I am quite different.

1141
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:02,125
The scream of Eulenspiegel

1142
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:03,792
(dramatic music)

1143
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:06,125
Cry.

1144
01:09:06,417 --> 01:09:08,292
Dark organ music.

1145
01:09:11,042 --> 01:09:13,333
The bell is ringing.

1146
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:21,583
The bell is tolling.

1147
01:09:34,375 --> 01:09:36,042
Scream

1148
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:40,083
Pop music

1149
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:43,958
<i>Black-brown is the hazelnut,
Black-brown am I also.</i>

1150
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:48,375
<i>Black-brown shall be
my girl, just like me.</i>

1151
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:52,958
<i>Black-brown is the hazelnut,
Black-brown am I also.</i>

1152
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:57,375
<i>Black-brown shall
be my girl,<br>just like me.</i>

1153
01:09:58,208 --> 01:10:02,583
<i>Black-brown, Black-brown,
Black-brown, Black-brown,</i>

1154
01:10:02,667 --> 01:10:07,083
<i>Schwarzbraun, Schwarzbraun,
Schwarzbraun, Yeah!</i>

1155
01:10:07,208 --> 01:10:09,625
March music...

1156
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:20,833
What's going on,<br>it
doesn't rain anymore.

1157
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:24,458
Let's quickly get away from
here. Yes, we're going to my place.

1158
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:28,417
Happy flute music

1159
01:10:37,875 --> 01:10:41,417
<i>Everything up until here has gone
exactly as it was written in my book,<br></i>

1160
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:44,667
<i>But what was most important
came yet still,<br>the night.</i>

1161
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:49,250
<i>What do you actually do at
night? I am just so excited.</i>

1162
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,792
Do you have hunger?
- No, do you have a towel?

1163
01:10:56,875 --> 01:10:57,917
A moment.

1164
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:01,583
Ah, the towel is
hanging in the bathroom.

1165
01:11:01,667 --> 01:11:04,500
"There's just one washcloth
hanging." "But that's definitely a towel."

1166
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:08,583
-One can just put your hand in
it.-That's why it's also called a towel.

1167
01:11:08,667 --> 01:11:12,250
-What's all that noise?-I'm
making it cozy for us.

1168
01:11:15,292 --> 01:11:17,500
Spray sounds

1169
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:21,458
Romantic music.

1170
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:27,750
The bathroom is free.

1171
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:31,208
(loud gulping)

1172
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:35,042
...are you free? Who let him
out? I had it extra tightly bound.

1173
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:37,958
<i>The bathroom is free, yes,
it's a public bathhouse indeed.</i>

1174
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:41,000
Instrumental music.

1175
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:43,792
<i>Oh, you're so sweet.</i>

1176
01:11:44,917 --> 01:11:47,292
Do you have soft hair?

1177
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:49,958
<i>You have but lovely eyes.</i>

1178
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:54,542
<i>And how impertinent
your nose is.</i>

1179
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:57,625
<i>And how long are your ears.</i>

1180
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:01,125
<i>Good heavens tight buttocks.</i>

1181
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:02,750
Hollow knocking.

1182
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:06,333
Oh, and this sweet,
small Stummel's tail.

1183
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:13,083
Ahaha! By the way, now show
me where the hammer hangs.

1184
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:16,958
You're not doing that, it's not your
style; taking an opportunity like this.

1185
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:20,208
But it is indeed the opportunity,
Opportunity makes love.

1186
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:24,208
Moment, I'm the one with the wide sayings,
I, and love is something entirely different.

1187
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:26,542
The love, the love, is
heavenly power.

1188
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:27,667
Oh, he's singing too now!

1189
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,208
Otto, listen to me.<br>
No, listen to me.

1190
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:32,208
No, me! I'm not listening
to anyone anymore.

1191
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:34,500
(The door swings
open) Now he does it.

1192
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,417
No, no, he doesn't do it.

1193
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:38,792
Do we not want to do
it? What do you mean?

1194
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:40,708
-A round of pens.
-Okay.

1195
01:12:40,792 --> 01:12:43,125
(Loud yawning, Sleep music)

1196
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:58,917
What's wrong with my axis?

1197
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:04,875
Remember, show them never your feelings, and
they'll hang around you like a fish on a hook.

1198
01:13:05,083 --> 01:13:07,250
Don't ever show your feelings.

1199
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,250
Loud explosion? Na, Baby?

1200
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:11,833
Is it late? Good
Lord, how late is it?

1201
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,542
-About eight, if you're interested.
-Actually, I should have left a long time ago.

1202
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,167
Why are you still here?

1203
01:13:19,917 --> 01:13:21,958
Otto, you wanted to
say something more.

1204
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:26,000
Something important. If you don't
tell me now, I really have to leave.

1205
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:29,458
Travelers should not be stopped.

1206
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:32,708
It's no trouble,
if I'm going now.

1207
01:13:32,792 --> 01:13:37,542
Do you know, Baby,
someday,<br>we have to go, somehow,

1208
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:38,958
Nowhere.

1209
01:13:39,042 --> 01:13:40,667
<i>It's a shame, Otto.</i>

1210
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:43,333
Don't make a big
deal out of it, Baby.

1211
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:46,708
It's the same for all after one night with me.

1212
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,583
Here's looking at you, Kid!

1213
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:54,167
The door slams shut.

1214
01:13:57,583 --> 01:13:59,083
What have you forgotten, baby?

1215
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:00,875
Women...

1216
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:02,792
The door slams shut.

1217
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:07,667
I have to tell her.

1218
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:12,167
Excuse me, I had never
had the courage to tell you,

1219
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:16,375
But you're wonderful, <i>one-of-a-kind,
you're the dearest person I know.</i>

1220
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:19,042
<i>I love you, and I
will always love you.</i>

1221
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:22,750
I will be loved.

1222
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:24,917
<i>That</i>

1223
01:14:25,042 --> 01:14:27,375
This is the most
beautiful day in my life.

1224
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:30,208
That has never been
said by a human to me.

1225
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:35,542
These words: I...I love you.

1226
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:38,500
Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

1227
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:39,958
I have to see Silvia.

1228
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:42,583
You'll be fine here.
Hello, Stavros?

1229
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:47,375
I'm going, do you mind
watching Rudi? Of course.

1230
01:14:47,667 --> 01:14:49,208
-Are you being kind to him, yes?
-Of course, I am.

1231
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:50,875
I must go to Silvia.

1232
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,000
The door slams shut.

1233
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:01,542
It was just a joke.

1234
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:03,750
Louder and louder
airplane noises...

1235
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:25,667
Carnival horns.

1236
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:31,542
<i>The captain and his crew are
delighted,<br>to be welcomed as guests.</i>

1237
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,167
<i>The city is already in carnival fever,<br>the
mood barometer is constantly rising.</i>

1238
01:15:38,042 --> 01:15:43,375
<i>Turbulences will come your way,<br>but
hopefully first under the sugar hat.</i>

1239
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:46,125
<i>We wish you a pleasant flight.</i>

1240
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:50,125
<i>Our charming staff will greet you
with refreshments of your choice.</i>

1241
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:53,667
Loosened party noises.

1242
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:57,917
(Passengers sing
a carnival song)

1243
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:08,000
(exhausted, loud breathing)

1244
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,750
Once and never again.

1245
01:16:14,792 --> 01:16:15,833
Or?

1246
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:20,417
(Passengers sing Carnival songs)

1247
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:27,667
<i>It's so hot in
Hawaii, no cool spot.</i>

1248
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:33,167
<i>and just Hula-Hula...</i>

1249
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:35,958
You must drink;
otherwise you will fall.

1250
01:16:36,667 --> 01:16:38,208
Since when have we
been using each other?

1251
01:16:38,417 --> 01:16:40,792
For you still Herr
Sonnemann, Herr Haenlein!

1252
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:44,625
That's okay, then drink
up! You will have it.

1253
01:16:45,292 --> 01:16:48,500
You know exactly about my war
injury it forbids me from drinking alcohol.

1254
01:16:48,625 --> 01:16:52,333
Why? Are you drinking with
your 5cm long scar under the eye?

1255
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:53,417
with the mouth?

1256
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,542
Frivolity.

1257
01:16:54,917 --> 01:16:57,750
This is the last bank
robbery, I have done with you.

1258
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:59,750
You're being quite
bold, Mr. Sonnemann.

1259
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:06,208
Sir Captain, we must
overthrow,<br>ahem, correct, ah, soften.

1260
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:08,708
Why, what's going on? It's
two bank robbers on board.

1261
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:11,333
I know them very well,</br>they are
named Hanemann and Sonnilein.

1262
01:17:11,417 --> 01:17:14,500
What do you tell me about that?
Tell me what Interpol says in Rio.

1263
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:16,958
Yes, but how then?<br>Yes, you're
certainly the radio operator.

1264
01:17:17,042 --> 01:17:18,417
Axis, Aye-Aye, Sir.

1265
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,458
Hello? Hello Rio?
Hello Interpol?

1266
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:26,167
<i>We have two bank
robbers on board.</i>

1267
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,667
<i>Prepare everything
for,<br> a fifth arrest.</i>

1268
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:32,750
<i>And another tip, be careful,<br>the
two may indeed be armed.</i>

1269
01:17:32,833 --> 01:17:35,792
(Sinister music) <i>Hello?
Hello Rio? Hello Interpol?</i>

1270
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:37,292
<i>Have you understood me?</i>

1271
01:17:38,417 --> 01:17:41,375
<i>Hello Rio? Hello Interpol?
Have you understood me?</i>

1272
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:45,958
Yes? Yes, two robbers.<br>Two
robbers came into the bank.

1273
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:48,167
The one thick, /
The other thin, yes.

1274
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:53,833
Hands up!

1275
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:57,292
This is an airplane hijacking, and you
are going to fly us straight to Cuba now.

1276
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,750
No, to Argentina.

1277
01:17:58,917 --> 01:17:59,875
Or Kuwait?

1278
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:01,250
That's too much for me.

1279
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:04,083
Then I prefer Ghana.
-That's too close to me.

1280
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:08,500
- How about south east Asia?
- You sadistic beast!

1281
01:18:09,042 --> 01:18:10,542
Yes, are you crazy?

1282
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:12,875
Now you've killed
the pilot. Why?

1283
01:18:13,417 --> 01:18:15,208
I did it anyway.

1284
01:18:15,292 --> 01:18:17,708
I have seen it
exactly, so you did it!

1285
01:18:17,917 --> 01:18:21,208
-Sorry! I didn't do that!
-He didn't do it, I saw it.

1286
01:18:21,292 --> 01:18:24,750
-Naturally he's done it that way!
-Yes, are you out of your mind, Sonnemann?

1287
01:18:24,958 --> 01:18:27,042
The man is our last hope.

1288
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:29,917
-One must surely fly!
-But I cannot fly.

1289
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:32,958
I can't handle any objection.

1290
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:36,375
They are flying.

1291
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:43,958
(tense music)

1292
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:21,958
Splashing noise.

1293
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:24,667
Yes, what are you doing
there? You can't even fly.

1294
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:26,583
Can I really?

1295
01:19:26,667 --> 01:19:27,792
Groaning

1296
01:19:28,417 --> 01:19:31,500
Haha, technical knockout
before the first round!

1297
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:33,917
Dark music.

1298
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,500
That is an airplane hijacking.

1299
01:19:36,083 --> 01:19:38,833
They killed the
pilot, and the co-pilot.

1300
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:41,708
Ernesto.

1301
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:45,167
You must fly! You
do have an airplane.

1302
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,625
No, I haven't.

1303
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:48,792
Is Ernesto?

1304
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:51,125
And what's with your hacienda?

1305
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:52,458
I don't have any.

1306
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:54,125
I have no jaguar.

1307
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:56,042
I have no servants.

1308
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:57,250
I have nothing.

1309
01:19:58,542 --> 01:20:00,167
Ernesto.

1310
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:02,125
I'm also not Ernesto.

1311
01:20:03,083 --> 01:20:04,125
But?

1312
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,542
Harold

1313
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:11,458
Snoring sounds.

1314
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:17,958
Ah, haha!

1315
01:20:18,042 --> 01:20:23,083
Parties are getting louder.

1316
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:43,333
Madam and Gentlemen,<br>here
speaks your Captain, Otto.

1317
01:20:43,417 --> 01:20:47,375
I have a very important announcement,
Silvia, I love you, holla-di-hitti!

1318
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:48,667
Otto!

1319
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:50,500
Romantic music.

1320
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:56,667
It's Rio in front of you.

1321
01:20:58,042 --> 01:20:59,500
Sit down quickly.

1322
01:21:01,333 --> 01:21:03,375
That's supposed to be Rio.

1323
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:06,667
That's much bigger
than I had imagined.

1324
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:10,958
This is never in
life Rio de Janeiro!

1325
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:15,333
(Dramatic music)

1326
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:27,125
Hurray.

1327
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,958
-No!- -Ja!

1328
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,417
No,!

1329
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:42,917
Oh no!

1330
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:45,375
Yeah!

1331
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:49,125
Loud crunching.<br> Ah ha ha!

1332
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:52,208
explosion

1333
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:59,208
Yes, that was a long story.

1334
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:00,958
And it's very educational.

1335
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:03,958
We have learned
something. Rio is much bigger.

1336
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:05,250
And interesting.

1337
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:08,125
Will I ever see my Sylvia again?

1338

(Whistling<br>Flight Song)

1339
01:22:17,917 --> 01:22:18,917
Otto.

1340
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:24,667
Hurrah, we're in sight!

1341
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:27,583
Hurray!

1342
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,167
Hurray!

1343
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,083
Ominous music.

1344
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:37,958
...there will come loud gauchos.

1345
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:42,375
one, two, it's enough.

1346
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:44,875
Forest noises.

1347
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:58,208
Rest now, gentlemen!

1348
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:04,083
We will now, possibly.

1349
01:23:04,708 --> 01:23:08,625
as first representative,
of our Western culture,

1350
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:12,417
This unmarried
island is entered.

1351
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,750
We want to behave accordingly.

1352
01:23:16,167 --> 01:23:19,292
Well done! Gentlemen,

1353
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,750
More dignity!

1354
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:25,917
Carnival march music

(German saying:) There flies, the holes out of the cheese.

1357

Huh! Huh! Huh!

<i>Here come the holes
out of the cheese.</i>

1361
01:24:01,417 --> 01:24:05,667
<i>Because now she's
off, our Polonäse</i>

1362
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:10,292
<i>From Blankenese
to behind Wuppertal.</i>

At Kamen's Cross right away

1364
01:24:13,583 --> 01:24:16,875
<i>We're off, with very big steps</i>

1365

<i>And he picks up Heidi
from behind at the shoulder.</i>

yes then comes joy on</i>

<i>Come on Grandma, let's go.</i>

1368
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:31,792
<i>The orchestra on stage
is driving madness.</i>

1369
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:35,333
<i>The pianist is pulling
all the keys out.</i>

1370
01:24:36,292 --> 01:24:39,625
<i>The tuba blows the beat
away from the drummer.</i>

1371

<i>The Conductor cries
and shouts: "Light out!"</i>

1372

Ocean sounds

1373
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,750
Are you going to make
me happy tonight?

1374
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:53,833
Are you also making me happy twice?
- Yes.

1375
01:24:54,208 --> 01:24:55,875
Also three times?

1376
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:58,833
There they were again,
my three problems...
